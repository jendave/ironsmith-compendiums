1  THE ICELANDS | BASED ON NORSE MYTHOLOGY
THE ICELANDS

Inspired by Norse Mythology

IRONSMITH: FLAVOR PACKS      2
   THE ICELANDS

   Each Flavor Pack for the Ironsworn RPG is inspired by some culture's

   mythology. The ideas presented are not exact duplicates of myths,

   cultures, or creatures from those cultures, but rather are general ideas

   meant to evoke a slightly different feeling rather than the viking-like

   setting of the Ironsworn core setting.

   However, the Icelands Flavor Pack was inspired by Norse mythology and

   thus fits very closely with the original setting.

   The Icelanders had always believed firmly in the gods as the

   guiding force of life. When they were forced to flee their ancestral

   homelands in the Old World to settle on the frigid northern

   continent, they believed that their gods had set this fateful

   migration in motion. What they didn't expect was to be walking

   directly among the descendants and archetypes of their religious

   texts and legends.

   The land itself spoke of the gods as each region correlated with

   one of the nine realms. The people viewed this as evidence of the

   truth of their religion, but as the reality of the situation set in, it

   was far from comforting. Life was hard enough in this snow

   covered environment without having to worry about offending

   ancient beings who were more savage than the legends made them

   out to be. Here in the north, they realized that some of the aspects

   of their faith were better left unseen and unknown.

   In order to survive in this new world, the Icelanders had to restrict

   themselves mainly to the Midgard area due to the dangerous

   Firstborn in other areas. They also were forced to split into small

   clans of closely related kin known as ætts so that it was possible to

   keep from starving by having a smaller number of mouths to feed.

   Each clan became ruled by an aristocratic war chieftain known as

   a Jarl. The free folk who swear loyalty to the Jarl, known as Karls,

   are usually kin of the Jarl and take care of the day-to-day business

   of staying alive by farming, smithing, hunting, building, etc. While

   the Karls make up the majority of a clan, there are those clans who

   still keep the Old World tradition of keeping Thralls, an enslaved

   servant class comprised of those captured during raids, that can

   make up a significant portion of a clan's population.

   The Icelanders are a fierce people whose fight to survive has

   hardened them even more, but they also sing, have fellowship, and

   drink to the hope that one day they will enter into the sacred halls

   of Valhalla before Ragnarok takes them all.

3                      THE ICELANDS | BASED ON NORSE MYTHOLOGY
NEW REGIONS

Each region in the Icelands corresponds to a region on the normal

Ironsworn map. In this way, you can continue to use the same map while

still getting a new flavor for the setting.

Within the Icelands, each region corresponds to one of the nine realms.

While the regions are not exact duplicates of the realms of Norse legend,

they bear some characteristics of them.

The original Ironsworn regions change as follows:

1. Barrier Islands  Niflheim (Realm of Ice)

2. Ragged Coast  Nidavellir (Land of Dwarves)

3. Deep Wilds  Alfheim (Land of Elves)

4. Flooded Lands  Muspelheim (Land of Fire)

5. Havens  Midgard (Land of Humans)

6. Hinterlands  Vanaheim (Land of Vanir)

7. Tempest Hills  Jotunheim (Land of Giants)

8. Veiled Mountains  Asgard (Land of Æsir)

9. Shattered Wastes  Hel (Land of the Dead)

   NIFLHEIM                                 REALM OF ICE AND FOG

   Replaces: Barrier Islands (Region 1)     Nilfheim

   Features:

   ·  Tumultuous waves that crash        ·  Hardy fisher-folk

      down with jagged ice pellets       ·  Daring pirates with heated iron

   ·  Powerful currents                     prows on their ships

   ·  Ice floe and ice bergs             ·  Ice-dwelling creatures

   ·  Billowing clouds of snow and       ·  Shipwrecks frozen in open sea

      fog obscuring vision               ·  Rocky islands nearly

   ·  Frequent blizzards                    indistinguishable from ice bergs

   Known as the Realm of Ice and Fog, the barrier islands off the western

   coast are covered in perpetual ice and a dense fog made of swirling snow.

   The sea itself freezes each winter thereby extending the mainland continent

   several miles west to the islands of Niflheim and even beyond.

   The few Icelanders who make their living here do so at great peril. They

   live in large, iron-prowed ships designed to break through the ice as they

   hunt seal, walrus, and whales in between running from Jormungandr, the

   great beast. They learn at a young age to listen for sounds of cracking ice

   as one misstep can send them to a frigid grave as they hunt out on the ice.

   Quest: Legend tells of a vast trench known as Ginnungagap where the first

   giant Ymir was formed during the creation of the Icelands. When Ymir

   gained awareness, it began forging tools and weapons for itself, but the

   first such creations were discarded as not good enough for the giant. One

   of the discarded tools is said to be an ice pick known as Isabrot that can

   split the thickest glacier in twain. Why do you need such a tool? Who do

   you know that has a clue to the location of the fabled Isabrot?

NIDAVELLIR                            LAND OF THE DWARVES

Replaces: Ragged Coast (Region 2)     Nidaellir

Features:

·  Jagged cliff faces beaten into  ·  Tunnels in the ice from

   odd shapes by icy waves            Jormungandr's passing

·  Hidden iron doors leading to    ·  Ancient evergreens atop cliffs

   dwarven halls                   ·  Great stone beaches

·  Ice-covered sodden roaming      ·  Splintering fractals of inlets

Here the dwarves live in their great golden halls deep within the rocky

fjords where they guard the edge of the continent from Jormungandr. The

greatest master smith in the Icelands, the ancient dwarf Eitri, is said to have

forged three objects of power deep in the heart of Nidavellir: Gullinbursti,

the boar with golden bristles; Draupnir, the golden ring of power; and

Mjölnir, the hammer of Thor. When the sea is unfrozen, great waves crash

against the rocky cliffs whose power is said to have been harnessed for

Eitri's forge.

Few Icelanders have seen the golden halls of the dwarves as most are not

suffered to live if they discover one of the secret entrances to a dwarven

stronghold.The Icelanders who do manage to make a life here are nomadic

traders that move with the freezing of the sea to bring in hauls from the

Niflheim region. They are usually tolerated by the dwarves because they

keep to themselves above ground and bring in precious oil and blubber

from the whales hunted there.

Quest: The Ljós Reyðrong clan, or clan of the Burning Whale, was due

with a shipment of precious whale oil. The trading ship that meets them

every two weeks on the western coast found signs that the nomadic clan

headed east toward known dwarven territory. What happened to the clan?

Who do you know from the clan that motivates you to help with the search?

   ALFHEIM                                               LAND OF THE ELVES

   Replaces: Deep Wilds (Region 3)                       Alfheim

   Features:

   ·  Lush forests that can keep out         ·  Trees with blood red sap

      the worst bite of winter               ·  Patter of rain instead of snow

   ·  Shafts of light through                ·  Malevolent presence of nature

      quivering canopies                     ·  Elven cities of trees and

   ·  Deep caves in the hillsides               caverns

   At first glance, the land of the elves stands out as a peaceful and beautiful

   place on an otherwise harsh continent. However, the ancient forest carries

   an angry spirit that matches the centuries-old feud amongst the two clans

   of elves who can only be told apart by their stark white or bright golden

   masks. The few reports that have made it out speak of a great elven city in

   the trees known as Ýdalir and several smaller, underground strongholds.

   Icelanders who have ventured into this forest rarely make it back out alive

   and are usually found as arrow-filled corpses dumped on the forest edge.

   The forest itself is said to act in defense of the elves by warping trails,

   moving whole groves of trees, and even changing the course of rivers. The

   trees here weep blood when they are cut down causing anything made of

   its wood to be viewed as cursed.

   Quest: The settlement of Vatnholt is being harassed by elven archers, and

   no one knew why until one Karl admitted to taking a bone mask from the

   Alfheim forests. What do you need from the elves that tempts you to use the

   return of the mask as a bargaining chip?

MUSPELHEIM                                                  LAND OF FIRE

Replaces: Flooded Lands (Region  4)        Muspelheim

Features:

· Mineral rich swamps                      · Tidal waves with cooled lava

· Hot springs and steam vents              rocks pelting the shoreline

· Strange, rapid growing plants            · Perpetual fog

· Weather extremes                         · Burrowing creatures'dens

Known as the Realm of Fire, this land of swamp and marsh is kept warm

by an underwater volcano on the coast which superheats the ocean waters

there. Some of the lava reservoir must extend beneath the continent's edge

for there are several hot springs near the coast teeming with exotic life.

The difference in temperature between the coastal water and the majority

of the icy continent causes great storms to drive boiling waters and humid

winds further inland. In the mid-latitudes of Muspelheim, each of these

super storms starts a new cycle of the volcanic water killing off much of

the swamp life followed by a rapid cooling back to near or below freezing.

As a result, the area is nearly desolate, and Icelanders who venture here are

often seeking the few rare creatures or plants that have adapted to life in an

environment of such alternating extremes.

Quest: A hummock containing a shrine and marking a safe path through

the swamp has recently been flooded. A new path must be found for the

local settlement to maintain contact with the world at large. Straying into

unknown territory is always dangerous, but certain supplies can only be

traded for and are running out soon. Which way do you go?

   MIDGARD                                                  LAND OF HUMANS

   Replaces: Havens (Region 5)              MIDGARD

   Features:

   ·  Long, harsh winters                ·  Festivals with feats of strength

   ·  Heavily guarded vineyards    over  ·  Funeral rites honoring the

      rolling hills                         bones of the earth

   ·  Sounds of rattling bones in  the   ·  Bone-carvers with mystic

      wind                                  weapons

   Midgard is so named as it is literally in the middle of this new world, an

   island among monsters and gods. Most Icelanders make their home in this

   region as it provides some natural protections in the form of a great wall

   made of bone surrounding the whole region. The bones appear to be giant

   rib bones that jut out of the ground between three and ten feet high.

   According to the iron priests, this barrier was made from the remains of

   Ymir, the first giant. Regardless of how it was created, the fence-like wall

   does provide limited protection for the Icelanders who try to eek out their

   existence here, but it does nothing to stop the raiders and inter-settlement

   squabbles that plague the Icelanders from within the walls.

   Quest:Alarge section of the Wall of Ymir was breached by a huge creature.

   The nearby settlement was eventually able to defeat the creature but now

   they have two problems. The first: a huge monstrous corpse full of

   potentially dangerous biological fluids that is rotting in the midst of their

   settlement. The second: a gaping wound in the wall. Amystic says the wall

   can be coaxed to regrow if only the right talismans can be found. What do

   you think you may gain from harvesting the monster's corpse? Who do you

   know in this settlement that you care about protecting?

VANAHEIM                                              LAND OF THE VANIR

Replaces: Hinterlands (Region 6)                      anaheim

Features:

· Thick, colored grasses reaching     ·  Rustling in the grasses as

over your head                           creatures prowl

· Sparse and spindly trees            ·  Watchtowers dotting the region

· Isolated settlements                ·  Worn game and travel trails

Vanaheim is a vast tract of wild plains that the iron priests refer to as

"utangard" or "outside the fence". The grasses that grow here, known as

litr grass, have thorn-tipped blades and sport tall central stalks topped with

brightly colored grains with each color representing a different species of

plant. The grains vary in toxicity and nutrients to the point that different

animals seek out the grain based on their color and stay away from other

colors for fear of being poisoned.

Dotted across the plains, rail thin trees known as Whiparms flail about in

the frigid winds putting fierce welts and cuts on those who dare get too

close. Some Icelanders find success hunting and living in this region, but

they know they are branded as utangard-dwellers and therefore not under

protection of the people of Midgard.

Quest: A specific variety of litr grass only grows every thirteen years and

is due to blossom soon. Legend says the vanir can be found at such a time.

Who or what are the vanir, and why do you seek them?

    JOTUNHEIM                                   LAND OF GIANTS

    Replaces: Tempest Hills (Region 7)          Jotunheim

    Features:

    ·  Thick deciduous trees giving          ·  Giant stone pillars carved with

       way to shadowy and aged                  indecipherable runes

       conifers                              ·  Trees mysteriously toppled

    ·  Working mines in the rocky            ·  Strange tracks in the snow

       hillsides                             ·  Frequent earthquakes

    Believed to be the original home of giants, the hills of Jotunheim quiver

    and shake in frequent earthquakes that the iron priests say are created by

    the giants walking their realm. Occasional claims are made to have seen a

    group of giants passing south to perform a ritual of remembrance at the

    Wall of Ymir to the south of Jotunheim.

    Deep, dark forests of pines cover the hills except for the occasional rocky

    hilltop standing out in stark contrast to the verdant sea of trees. Winter

    rarely loosens its grip here, and most of the animals have bold white pelts

    that are highly prized by the Icelanders who risk hunting in this region.

    The Icelanders who do live here are called Jotun-Svein, servants of the

    giants, and have an uncanny ability to know when an earthquake is about

    to happen. Some even claim to be descended from giants, and have the

    strength and height to back up their claim, but this may only be myth.

    Quest: A monolithic pillar of stone has been found in a secluded hollow.

    What strange effect is it having on those near it? A mystic says the power

    can harnessed, but to what purpose?

11                THE ICELANDS | BASED ON NORSE MYTHOLOGY
ASGARD                                                   LAND OF AESIR

Replaces: Veiled Mountains (Region  8)                   Asgard

Features:

· Strange voices carried                    ·  Rumbles of avalanches

by the wind                                 ·  Blizzards obscuring vision

· Marbled and smooth rock                   ·  Unseen peaks above the clouds

surfaces

The Icelanders say that the gods live in these impenetrable mountains. The

peaks rise so high that they are normally obscured by cloud cover, but the

Icelanders tell stories of people who have climbed them and found that

each mountain actually ends not at a peak but in a circular depression in the

mountain top that houses a temple or fortress of the gods protected by the

walls of the mountain itself. Stories abound of hearing sounds of laughter

and revelry carried by the brutal winds, but it's hard to tell if this really

happens or if it's a figment of the climber's imagination as they begin to

freeze and starve to death in the harsh mountain range.

Regardless of the danger that god-like beings can pose, the mountains

themselves are also formidable. Few Icelanders make their homes here

due to the frequent avalanches, rock slides, brutal blizzards accompanied

by large other-worldly bolts of lightning.

Quest: Whether real or not, a young warrior seeks to take a pilgrimage to

the peaks of Asgard as a rite of passage and to obtain the blessing of the

gods in their journey as an ironsworn. Who is this young warrior to you,

and why do you feel compelled to accompany them?

    HEL                                         LAND OF THE DEAD

    Replaces: Shattered Wastes (Region   9)                            Hel

    Features:

    · Ghostly lights flickering              ·  Endless shuffling of horrors

    · Great shards of ice forming            ·  Distant castle facing north

    mind-bending sculptures                  ·  Screams of the living

    · Eternal darkness                          abandoned to their fate on a

                                                shore of corpses

    The iron priests say that Hel is either the underworld itself or at least the

    bridge to the realm of the dead. It is a land devoid of almost all life and

    permanently frozen solid. Most likely the receding edge of a glacier that

    has lasted through the ages, the landscape of Hel is also perpetually

    shrouded in darkness due to a celestial oddity where the heights ofAsgard

    block out the majority of sunlight.

    Horrors stalk these realms, and it is said that any Icelander who views the

    land of Hel will be haunted and pursued by a horror for daring to look upon

    that which no mortal or living being should see. Icelanders scare their

    children into obedience by proclaiming they will be "sent to live in the

    north" if they're not good. Some of the northern settlements make good on

    this promise and hire "Deathwalkers" to take the most dastardly criminals

    to the edges of Hel. The deathwalkers are regarded with fear and respect

    as they somehow survive their close encounters with the land of the dead.

    Quest: A deathwalker has finally lost their grip on reality and is now a

    raving lunatic with a sword spouting grim prophecies. One such prophecy

    affects someone close to you, but to unravel the riddle, you may have to

    help the deathwalker regain their mind. What makes this prophecy grim

    and urgent?

13                      THE ICELANDS | BASED ON NORSE MYTHOLOGY
NEW ASSETS

Just as the terrain and regions are different in the Icelands, so too are the

people and their skills. Here are some assets unique to the Icelands.

COMBAT TALENTS

Combat within the Icelands is usually a brutal affair, like two savage beasts

fighting over a kill. Winning by any means necessary is the name of the

game, and trickery or deceit in battle are seen as an homage to the god of

mischief. Nothing is out of bounds.

Despite this, there can still be a sense of honor, much like the "honor

among thieves" trope, where deceit in battle still technically follows the

agreed upon rules of engagement. It becomes of a battle of wits to see who

can exploit the rules of a duel more significantly to their advantage.

Since the Icelands resemble the original Ironlands so closely, most of the

original combat talents don't need any translation to fit into the Icelands

setting. Thus, instead of brand new combat talents, the Icelands offer

specific weapons of legend that may also count as rarities or artifacts.

    anywhere in the known regions

    of the Icelands. The bladed tip

    of the spear is etched with

    mystic runes that grant the

    wielder of the blade exceptional

    accuracy in battle. It is said that

    Odin himself once threw the

    spear from one realm to next and

    split an apple in half that Loki

    has holding in his hand.

    Design Notes:The actual legend

    of Gungnir also notes that great

    strength is passed on to its

    wielder, but I chose to focus on

    the accuracy aspect to bring into

    the Ironsworn rule system.

    Therefore, you'll note that all

    the abilities make a hit more likely.

    The first ability is a boost to accuracy no matter what but only when you're

    throwing the weapon away from you. You could also give this bonus even

    to melee attacks and treat it as a rarity so that rolling a 1 has consequences.

    (See the Delve supplement for rules on rarities.) The second ability also

    boosts your accuracy with a balancer of taking stress if you still miss. The

    third ability also boosts accuracy but can only be used once per battle.

    Again, there should probably be narrative consequences if the reroll ends

    up giving you a 1 on the action die or you still miss despite the reroll.

    Quest: Legend tells of a great warrior who before every battle threw

    Gungnir over the opposing army yelling, "Odin own you all!" The

    warrior would then fight his way forward to the spear and reclaim it along

    with victory in battle. However, in the warrior's last battle, a priest stepped

    forward from the front lines of the opposing army after Gungnir had been

    thrown and said to the warrior, "We are all owned by Odin. But you see

    yourself as his equal. I am sent with a message for you: Gungnir will not

    be used again until one comes who seeks to serve the gods, not become one

    themself." The great warrior fell in battle that day, and Gungnir is said to

    still be sticking in the earth where the warrior threw it. Rumors abound as

    to where this battlefield is and say that the spear still lies in wait for one

    humble in heart to claim it. Who do you know that may be worthy of the

    spear?

LAEVATEINN

Laevateinn is a magical staff

known literally as the "damage-

twig" and said to be kept in an

iron chest with nine locks deep

within the heart of Hel.       A

prophetic poem of the Icelands

describes this weapon with the

power of death as follows:

Answer this, o warrior.

Be there any other weapon

Before which the realms fall

To the dominion of Hel?

Laevateinn the twig is named,

Plucked forth by Loki

Down by the gates of Hel.

In an iron chest it lies,

Alongside the queen,

With nine locks secured well.

The descriptions in legends of Laevateinn are murky, but the queen is said

to possibly be Sinmara, consort to the fire giant Sutr, ruler of the realm of

Muspelheim. It may be that the Icelander who seeks to wield this staff

must first find Sinmara and be granted her blessing.

Design Notes: It was hard to come up with appropriate abilities given such

sparse descriptions of this weapon, but I thought the idea of a magical

Norse staff was cool enough to include. I mean, damage twig? Really!?

So, I went with the idea of a necrotic staff. The first ability allows you to

do damage with the staff using magical blasts (hence, the +wits).

The second ability throws out a death magic area effect of some type. Use

your imagination! I thought of foes clutching their chest in pain as the

magic manifests a near heart attack, skeletal hands bursting forth from the

ground to grasp the feet of foes, or a tree falling in the foe's path as it ages

to death prematurely.

For the third ability is meant to represent Laevateinn's ability to command

horrors or other beings who draw their power from Hel.

Quest: Horrors are arriving in large herds to attack the Icelands

shepherded by a grim shaman with a staff that glows with darkness rather

than light. Who is this shaman, and why are they working with horrors?

    MJOLNIR

    The hammer of the god Thor is

    truly beyond compare. Within

    the exquisitely crafted head, the

    dwarven masters imbued a

    finely honed mastery over the

    power of lightning. It is from

    this weapon that any wielder of

    a hammer became known as a

    thunder-bringer, but the powers

    of this particular hammer are far

    beyond that of mortal weapons.

    Design Notes: This card has had

    a bit of a revision since its initial

    release. The first ability is now

    more balanced as a flavorful way

    to gain back the initiative in

    combat at the cost of not being

    able to deal damage.

    The second ability lets you

    gamble on a +heart roll to deal

    extraordinary damage, but a weak hit will yield a miss and cause stress.

    Notice that you don't get any add on this roll either.

    The third ability gives you a way to effectively get an add to a progress roll

    by subtracting from the challenge dice. However, there will often be

    collateral damage as fallout from the explosive ending to a fight.

    Quest: A powerful raider chieftain claims to have recovered the famous

    Mjolnir. However, the hammer has not yielded its power to the raider

    causing it to be unbalanced and better used as a paper weight. The raider

    chieftain claims they will give the hammer to whoever finds them a suitable

    spouse and land upon which to found a peaceful settlement. The raider has

    committed grievous crimes in the past, but peace in the area would allow

    all to prosper. Who do you know that has volunteered themself as spouse

    for this raider? Why are you willing to support them?

SKOFNUNG

The  bodyguards    of            the

legendary king Hrolf Kraki were

loyal to the point of fanaticism.

So much so, that all six willingly

sacrificed themselves in a mystic

ritual to be placed inside a jewel

of the king's blade, Skofnung.

From these gems, the spiritual

bodyguards rise forth in times of

need to aid their king. Will the

spirits help a wielder who is not

Kraki? Only time will tell.

Design Notes: The original

Skofnung had twelve berserker

bodyguards, but to fit on a

normal track, I used only 6.

Note that in order to power this

weapon, you must Endure Harm

yourself. However, I did not

specify how much harm to take

so that you can adjust it to your

liking. You might gain +1 essence for every -1 health you suffer, or you

might if you prefer a more deadly powering of the blade, gain +1 essence

for suffering -2 health. Set your own level of difficulty here.

The first ability represents the spiritual bodyguards coming forth from the

jewels in the blade. Again, I did not specify whether or not you could use

this power multiple times simultaneously, but in my mind, I was imagining

you burning all six essence to get six ghostly bodyguards to help you in a

big fight or something similar.

Since Skofnung is usually depicted as a dagger, the second ability grants

you access to the full combat talent associated with a dagger, but it costs

more essence to make happen.

The third ability brings out the idea that once Skofnung is drawn, its thirst

must be quenched which is exactly the Leech ability. It has a cost of three

essence because of the automatic strong hit on Leech.

Quest: The tomb of King Hrolf Kraki is said to have been found and the

legendary Skofnung is now loose out in the world. What makes you want

to delve the depths of Kraki's tomb despite the magical dagger not being

there as a prize?

    COMPANIONS

    Again, vanilla Ironsworn leans heavily into a Norse feeling, so many of the

    companions already fit well. However, I offer two additional companions:

    the Dire Wolf as a common trope and Hugin and Munin as a more specific

    version of the Raven companion.

    DIRE WOLF

    It's the howling that really gets

    to you. Awolf's howl is already

    chilling in the depths of the

    Icelands as you know the pack is

    hot on your trails, but a dire

    wolf's      howl  is    something

    altogether different. The deep

    bass of the howl communicates

    the size of such a beast and the

    confidence it has in tracking its

    prey.   Some Icelanders have

    befriended such a beast, but it

    takes months or even years to

    earn the respect and loyalty of a

    dire wolf.

    Design Notes: This gives you a

    boost to tracking and to combat.

    I mainly envision the dire wolf

    as a combat-focused companion

    who is all about hunting and

    taking down the prey. Remember that  the  trade  off  for  those  boosts  is  that

    your companion is exposed to harm.

    Quest: An ancient dire wolf was befriended by the settlement of Vargrbær

    years ago when the people helped save the cubs of the mother wolf. It has

    been many years since the cubs have grown, and each departed the region

    to claim its own territory. The mother, name Móðir by the settlement,

    stayed and acted as a general guardian for the townsfolk, and the people

    in turn protected her.

    Two weeks ago, the people stopped hearing Móðir's howl at night, and she

    has not been sighted since then. The people of Vargrbær are seeking

    someone to help them find out what has happened to their dear Móðir, but

    no stranger has yet been willing to take on the task knowing that the fierce

    she-wolf is a danger to anyone she isn't already familiar with. What makes

    you particularly qualified to help, and why do you feel compelled to do so?

19                          THE ICELANDS | BASED ON NORSE MYTHOLOGY
HUGIN AND MUNIN

These two ravens are said to

have come from the region of

Hel, north of the Asgardian

mountains.       Beneath       their

feathers lies a thick coat of down

adding       to  their    already

considerable bloated girth. The

pair are unsightly, bordering on

grotesque, and cause even the

most stout Icelander to feel a

shiver down their spine for

seeing Hugin and Munin means

that death is circling. Do these

ravens serve the ironsworn that

they are bound to, or does the

ironsworn        serve   them  and

therefore death itself?

Design Notes: I wanted these

birds to have a dark and

foreboding vibe. If they're on

your heels, you know bad stuff is

about to go down. The first ability speaks of "one marked by death." That

can mean anything you want in your game. It might mean someone you

have sworn to defeat, or it could mean an innocent that is fated to die in a

cruel twist. Hugin and Munin can sense this deathly pall and guide you

towards it.

The second ability gives you another method to Secure an Advantage but

carries a risk as well. While you could figure out someone's fears with a

Compel check and then use that to Secure an Advantage, this gives you a

flavorful and mystic way to jump straight to the advantage instead.

The third ability represents the birds building towards a frenzy when death

is on the line. I envision them cawing and circling the battle ever more

frantically as the battle moves on. They also impart that energy to you as

you move closer to death yourself.

Quest: A pair of ravens being called the Duðar-Orð, or Tidings of Death,

have been traveling south stopping at settlements along the way to circle a

specific person who then dies within a week. Riders are now moving ahead

of the birds warning of their coming, but the birds have not been dissuaded

from a target. What are these birds, and what power do they hold? Who

do they even now circle over that you would protect with your life?

    PATHS

    Path assets in the Icelands often are associated with a specific god from the

    pantheon. When you take one of these assets, also envision how your

    character had a brush with one such being that set them on this path.

    DISCIPLE OF HEL

    There are those Icelanders who

    seek to understand and honor

    death as a cherished part of life.

    Those on this path rarely fear

    death and even have a limited

    ability to control death. But this

    relationship often comes with a

    cost as death entwines its own

    desires with the fate of the

    ironsworn on this path. Be wary

    of death, for she is a fickle

    mistress.

    Design Notes: In my mind,

    these abilities build on top of

    each other. The first shows the

    desire to honor death and how

    ushering a fallen comrade into

    the halls of Valhalla brings

    comfort.         However, there's

    always a chance that their death

    reveals a complication that only

    your character can intuit. This may come in    the form of a vision    from    the

    departed, a connection to horrors, or another  supernatural source.

    The second ability makes you more effective as dealing death but it comes

    with the potential for immense stress over the killing of a sapient being.

    The third allows you to either stave death off at a critical moment by

    accepting a mission from the goddess of Hel or to go out in a blaze of glory.

    That is, as long as you don't roll a 1!

    As a world building option, you could turn this path into a whole cult of

    zealots who worship the goddess of death. You slay them, but they keep

    being returned to life by Hel herself.

    Quest: An acolyte of an obscure faith lives in an isolated area but is often

    called upon to perform ceremonial rites over those who have died with

    honor. This person, known as the Death Singer, has now arrived in a

    settlement without invitation saying that they will be needed soon. What

    unseen threat is at hand? Why does the Death Singer's augury particularly

    unsettle you?

21                   THE ICELANDS | BASED ON NORSE MYTHOLOGY
DISCIPLE OF LOKI

Capricious.       That is the best

word to describe those who

worship and follow the tenets of

the god Loki. They lie and back

stab so often that it becomes

predictable. Even so, they are

skilled in the art of deceit, and

their treachery may not be

discovered until much later.

Design Notes: The first ability is

a straight up boost to trickery

and deceit much the same as the

Trickster    asset  in        core

Ironsworn.

The second ability (suggested by

user Hteph on the Ironsworn

Discord) lets you force a strong

hit when you use the first ability,

but it comes with a terrible price.

The next time any two dice

match values (meaning your action die and at least one challenge die or

both challenge dice), you automatically turn it into a miss with a match.

You can push your luck, but it always comes back to haunt you

unexpectedly.

The third ability allows you to Sojourn through trickery. Maybe you claim

to be someone you're not, or perhaps you give them a false report that

they've been eagerly awaiting so you are heralded as the bringer of good

news. However you deceive them, there's a stronger chance that you'll

miss have to face the consequences.

Quest: A dictatorial overseer holds their citizens in check by having them

swear a series of malicious vows where the loopholes in the wording of the

vow always work to the overseer's advantage. Who do you know in this

settlement that seeks freedom from this oppression? What convoluted and

seemingly senseless quest does this overseer want to send you on in order

to win the freedom of this citizen?

    DISCIPLE OF THOR

    The god Thor is a protector, not

    only of people, but of the earth.

    He is said to hold the power to

    bless the earth and the fruit that

    comes from it, even the fruit of

    the womb. The people call out

    to him in their times of need, and

    when the god Thor hears the

    cries of the righteous, he comes

    down with a vengeance on the

    wings of a tempestuous storm.

    Woe to those who stand before

    Thor in his wrath.

    Those who swear an allegiance

    to the god of thunder gain a

    portion of his power. They are

    sought  out       for  to    impart

    blessings and to become the

    champions of the downtrodden.

    However, they are also known

    for their penchant for ale horns,

    so keep one nearby.

    Design Notes: The god Thor is well-known for his thunder and lightning

    (third ability), but I wanted to bring out some of the other sides of the

    mythology, namely his bravery (first ability) and his ability to call forth

    blessings (second ability).

    For the second ability, I left it vague as to the purpose. In most cases, I

    would rule it as a Secure an Advantage move, but there could be a case

    made that you are making direct progress on a vow (like removing a curse)

    rather than a specific move, so I didn't define it. However, in most cases,

    I would treat it like a Secure an Advantage roll.

    The third ability is also vague on how the storm manifests. Maybe you are

    calling lightning to increase the chances a Strike or Clash will hit, calling

    forth dark clouds to obscure your travel, or calling peals of thunder to

    drown out the chants of an evil zealot. Make the manifestation of the storm

    fit your own story.

    Quest: An overseer and her spouse have called out to the gods for years to

    receive the blessing of a child but to no avail. In their frustration and

    hubris, they then demanded this of the gods at which point a prophet came

    to town proclaiming that the overseer was indeed with child but that it

    would come with the price of an innocent life. The curse fell upon one you

    care deeply about. Who is it, and how is the curse manifesting?

RITUALS

Ritual magic and mysticism in the Icelands is generally held in high regard.

Seers or prophets are often consulted before important decisions are made.

BIFROST

It is said that the god Heimdall

once controlled the Bifrost with

a powerful sword, but that sword

was shattered centuries ago.

Now those who obtain a shard of

Heimdall's sword may attempt

to summon the Bifrost allowing

them to travel great lengths in

mere moments. However, this

magic does not go unnoticed and

people often hunt a "rainbow

rider" to gather the shard for

their own use.

Design Notes: This roll is made

+heart to show your character's

will and righteous motives

powering the magic. You may

choose if your character must

have a shard of Heimdall's blade

or not to summon Bifrost as it

fits best in your story.

The first ability allows you to travel the Bifrost, but blinding, prismatic

light rarely goes unnoticed. On a weak hit (or even a miss), somebody or

something is going to notice and make your character's life harder.

The second ability lets you peer through the Bifrost to scry on a friend or

ally at another location. Even if you can't communicate directly with

them, they will be aware of your presence on a weak hit or miss.

The third ability is where you try to pull someone to you by activating the

Bifrost. Since this is so powerful, the challenge dice can never be below 5

and a weak hit puts the person being transported at risk somehow. Maybe

they take physical harm, lose an important item along the way, or catch a

glimpse of some threat that is following them through the Bifrost.You may

alter this ability to only be used at a Bifrost node where you physically

insert a shard of Heimdall's blade into an iron pillar. Make it your own!

Quest: A group of raiders have found shards of Heimdall's blade and use

the Bifrost to attack and overwhelm settlements before they can mount a

defense. In the last raid, they captured something or someone important to

you. Who or what is it, and why did the raiders go after that target?

    SEIDHR

    Those who practice the ritual of

    seidhr can both foretell and

    shape the future, but it is a

    dangerous magic for it depends

    on the whims of the three sisters

    of fate: the Norn. It is said that

    to able to harness such power,

    one must somehow catch the

    fancy of one of the Norn sisters

    which is both a blessing and a

    curse, much like the knowledge

    of future events is a doubled-

    edged blade.

    Design Notes: If you choose,

    you may have your character

    undertake a quest to gain access

    to this ritual. On a roleplaying

    note, going before the Norn is

    likely to be a disorienting affair.

    Your character is before a set of

    near divine beings and viewing

    knowledge that no mortal was meant   to  see.

    Whatever time period you pick, think of the vision from this asset as

    working in a similar fashion as the Augur, Divination, or Scry assets from

    core Ironsworn. Your character gets some sort of vision of true events, but

    they are filtered by the Norn to have your character see what they want you

    to see in order to bring the fates to fruition. You may choose to have the

    visions be more chaotic as they move towards the future. Past events are

    clear, present are murky, and future is a blur.

    Also, feel free to not fully define what actual knowledge you gain from this

    vision until you find a cool spot for it to fit into your story. When you're

    ready, flashback to describe the full scope of the vision the Norn sent you,

    and then describe how you take advantage of that in the present moment.

    Quest: A highly regarded seer has slipped into a trance in an effort to see

    all possible future outcomes. They appear frozen in time and have not

    emerged from the trance in nearly a week. What dark future are they

    seeing, and can you alter it by joining them in their vision?

NEW FOES

The foes of the Icelands stick closely to the original Ironsworn foes. As

such, you should feel free to do a complete swap with these foes if you so

choose. For example, the elves in the Icelands also wear masks but have a

slightly different feel to them as there is a civil war between the two

dominant clans of elves in the Icelands.

Additionally, these foes are not the exact same as their namesakes, but that

was the starting place for creating a foe that fit the Ironsworn system and

Icelands setting. For example, some foes take their name from a single

creature of legend but are presented here as smaller, more common

versions of those foes to make them less god-like and more fantastical

beast-like.

For example, the Veðrfölnir is originally a single hawk involved in the

legend of the World Tree, but here I've presented them as a whole species

of hawks that serve (or at least fly around with) a more powerful eagle.

    Compared to the struggle of everyday existence, they would seem a small

    thing, but oh, they are clever. They drop nuts on our heads to make us think

    someone else threw it at us, and some even work in tandem to make

    another Icelander laugh at the same time to increase the enmity between us.

    As we rough and tumble "for our honor," they are chewing through the

    sides of our packs and making off with our food.

    Worse yet, their large size, that of a normal dog, makes them veritable

    fighters in their own right, particularly if they attack as a group. They

    sharpen their teeth by rubbing them against sandstone and have thick-

    boned tails that they can lock in place as if it were a stout club or mace.

The sleipnira are descendants of Odin's horse of the same name, and like

their namesake, they have eight legs and all the power and strength that

brings. They generally roam free in the Midgard region and are kept there

by Ymir's Wall. Being confined to a single region helps keep their

numbers in check as well.

Due to their power and direct divine lineage, many seek to tame a sleipnira

as a mount, but they are not so easily won over. The process is one of

slowly building a relationship of trust with the creature until they deign to

have a rider. Those who complete this process have not only one of the

strongest and swiftest mounts but also a fierce protector.

Many people have not survived a horse's kick with both their back legs, but

imagine our horror when we first saw someone get kicked with six back

legs! They start the kick with their back two legs and continue rising up

with a kick from the next pair of legs until they have attacked with six

hooves in rapid succession.

Quest: A group of elves in bright golden masks have emerged from Alfheim

and stand at the border of Midgard demanding a herd of sleipnira to breed

for their own. What purpose do they have in mind for sleipnira in the deep

wilds of Alfheim? You have encountered elves with golden masks before.

What happened then that gives you pause at interacting with them now?

YOUR TRUTH

Legend tells of Odin's original Sleipnira growing wings and

flying the god across the realms. Do winged sleipnira exist in

the Icelands now? If so, where are they, and what are they

called?

               ·        Puncture deeply with talons

    The vedrfolnir are overgrown hawks with pale underbellies and razor-

    sharp talons. Seeing a vedrfolnir overhead is considered good luck as it

    likely means that no poisonous snakes will dare come out of hiding.

    Conversely, being attacked by vedrfolnir is seen as a mark of shame since

    the great hawks view you as nothing more than a serpent.

    Falconers prize the vedrfolnir as one of the most intelligent birds to work

    with and train, but no Icelander is willing to capture a free vedrfolnir to

    make it submit to falconry. Rather, if an injured fledgling or wounded adult

    is found and nursed back to health, it is seen as a sign from the gods that

    training that particular bird is permitted.

    One strange quality of the vedrfolnir is their ability to kick up great gusts

    of wind with wings which they do to throw a pursuer off balance giving

    them time to flee.

    Quest: A group of fledglings have been crying out for days after their

    mother perished at the hands of a roving nidhoggr wyrmling. The local

    settlement viewed the family of vedrfolnir as a badge of honor and seek to

    save the newborn birds, but even a very young nidhoggr serpent is

    dangerous. Why is saving these birds a point of honor for you as well?

    YOUR TRUTH

    Some claim that vedrfolnir are empathic and can share

    thoughts and feelings with one that they bond with. Is there

    truth in this belief?

As with many creatures in the Icelands, the fenrirkin are descendants of a

creature of legend: Fenrir, the mighty wolf of fire. While not large enough

to take on the gods, the fenrirkin are still large, the size of dire wolves, and

retain their father's fiery trait in the form of jaws wreathed in flames.

Attacking a fenrirkin is rarely a good idea as they are good tacticians and

vicious to a fault. They don't just kill their prey, they make them suffer by

eating off appendages before finishing off their kill. Worse yet, the fiery

bite usually cauterizes wounds meaning their victims are sure to stay alive

until the fenrirkin want them dead. Avoid these beasts if at all possible lest

your life end in suffering.

Quest: A pack of fenrirkin have expanded their territory to include the

settlement of Brackwater. The wolves have become daring enough to

attack the village proper, and now a building has burnt down from their

last attack. Who did you lose in the resulting conflagration that causes you

to seek revenge on the beasts?

YOUR TRUTH

Are the fiery jaws of fenrirkin exaggeration? Is it really just

heat-filled jaws formed as a byproduct of chemical reactions

necessary for the fenrirkin to eat black iron? Or are the beasts'

bodies are fully wreathed in mystical flame?

    If only Jormungandr were a legend, but alas, it is not. The great serpent

    lives and has total control of the region of Niflheim where it hunts our

    whalers, other vessels and even kraken. Some of our smaller fishing boats

    have been wrecked by Jormungandr's passing likely without the great

    beast even taking notice.

    Not only is the creature deadly for its size and strength, but its very blood

    and bile are poisonous to many forms of life. The giant serpent will lie its

    head down at the mouth of river and push thick excretions out that slowly

    dissolve organic matter leaving nothing but stone untouched.

    It is said that Jormungandr still seeks revenge on the god Thor, and we

    believe that the god's ancient weapon, Mjolnir, may be the only weapon

    capable of harming the creature.

    Quest: The priesthood known as the Sect of the Storm believe that they can

    control Jormungandr's movements in the sea using their mystical powers

    to call forth a great storm. The theory is that Jormungandr will be drawn

    to the storm thinking it will find Thor, but they need a volunteer crew to test

    this idea. Why are you willing to do it? What happened in the past that

    convinces you of the need for such a desperate and dangerous plan?

    There is a cult that worships Jormungandr as an ancient divine

As if Jormungandr were not dangerous enough in the seas, there are kraken

as well. These creatures are so large that they are often mistaken for small

islands and even have exotic plant life growing on their heads that add to

the ruse. They can be patient as they wait for ships to land on their

"beaches" or for shipwreck survivors to swim to their "shores" at which

point they rapidly submerge pulling their prey to a swift underwater death.

If they are hungry enough, they forgo the trap and directly attack ships

instead. They can encircle even our largest ships with their tentacles and

then apply enough pressure to literally snap the ship in half. The only way

we have learned to survive a kraken attack is to quickly hack off one or

more of its tentacles. While the tentacles will regrow, it sometimes forces

the kraken to pause in its attack and consider a more vulnerable target.

Every ship we build has a set of kraken saws specially designed to make

short work of the musculature of a kraken tentacle.

Quest: The ship Tollak was returning from a meeting with the dwarves of

Nidavellir when a kraken attacked. Rather than try to fight it off, the crew

immediately jumped ship, and only a few Icelanders survived. One such

survivor says that the ship was never actually destroyed by the kraken since

it got its meal from the people jumping overboard. Now the ship is floating

crewless in the sea, and the survivor claims an artifact of great importance

is still on the ship. What is this artifact, and why do you need it?

              ·         Buffet with wings

    The mikillorn eagles are huge, as tall as a giant when they stand on the

    ground with wings furled, and while their size makes them look

    intimidating, they are usually very peaceful creatures. Some of our priests

    claim that the majestic birds have near human intelligence and even serve

    the gods as keepers of knowledge and wisdom. Whether their divine

    service is true or not, it is true that the mikillorn prefer to observe from a

    distance without acting, but that doesn't mean they never act.

    It is said that at critical junctures in history, the mikillorn have intervened

    to change fate: a hero questing to slay a nidhoggr wyrm stopped by

    mikillorn only to find that the nidhoggr was an exiled and cursed king, a

    dam torn apart by mikillorn right before a drought when downstream

    settlements would have died, and other such stories are regularly told. For

    this reason and the claim of their guardianship of theWorldTreeYggdrasil,

    the mikillorn are held in high esteem.

    However, there are those who hunt the mikillorn for their distinctive

    feathers which can be sold to those who practice the more nefarious side of

    the mystic arts. Perhaps because of this, the mikillorn have become more

    wary, not necessarily aggressive yet, but not to be trifled with.

    Quest: The settlement of Graycliff is in the grips of a plague, and a mystic

    claims they can cure the illness for the whole village if they posses a

    mikillorn feather. With its amplified ability to push on fate, the mystic

    believes the illness can be forced to burn itself out. However, mikillorn

    often die without their signature tail and crowning feathers. Do the ends

    justify the means?

Legend tells of the one true Nidhoggr who perpetually searches for the

Yggdrasil in the region ofAsgard in order to swallow up the tree, but there

are also descendants of Nidhoggr the Great Shadow. These lesser wyrms

can hardly be thought of as lesser. They can slink and stealth their way into

most places despite their great size, breathe out great clouds of pure

darkness, and even devour metal. No structure is truly safe from a

nidhoggr spawn on the hunt.

Being hunted by a nidhoggr is truly a curse as we believe they are

somehow drawn to those who break their oaths, the liars and cheats who

took things one step too far. One such oath breaker, Egil the Terror, used

this to his advantage to travel across the realms allowing the nidhoggr

following him to wreak havoc in his wake. It was one of the darkest

periods of time here in the Icelands, and the land itself still bears the scars

from Egil's Last March.

Quest: The warrior Ingeborg entered the settlement of Stoneford

    Known as the Bone Elves, the Dokkalfar have been at war with the

    Ljosalfar, or Gold Elves, for centuries. As near as we can make out with

    our limited contact with the firstborn, the two clans of elves had some petty

    dispute that continued to escalate until the Gold Elves cursed a significant

    population of the Bone Elves to be unable to function in normal sunlight.

    The Bone Elves retreated to the underground, and their physiology has

    morphed accordingly over the generations.

    In order to continue attacks on their light-dwelling cousins, the Dokkalfar

    began to wear intricate masks of bone designed to not only protect their

    skin from sunlight for a short time but also to enrage and frighten the

    Ljosalfar. You see, the masks are made from the remains of Ljosalfar.

    The war continues to rage even now, but luckily we see little of it in

    Midgard. However, if you are traveling in Alfheim and see a white-faced

    being in the distant shadows, pray that it is merely a ghost or another

    horror, for the Dokkalfar are likely to be far more terrorizing.

    Quest: The Dokkalfar elf known as Dûr-megil, the Dark Blade, has killed

    all of the members of Calsedryn's family, a Ljosalfar elf. Now Calsedryn

    is seeking someone to help take Dûr-megil's mask and give the remains a

The dwarves of Nidavellir are said to have descended from the corpse of

the first giant, Ymir, the same giant whose bones even now encircle

Midgard. The dwarves certainly do have a similar blue-tinted skin as the

remaining jotnar and often take scrapings of Ymir's Wall as payment for

goods and services.

Since long before we arrived in the Icelands, the dwarves have lived

underground because of the effect sunlight has on their skin: it causes their

skin to harden like stone. Scattered across Nidavellir, you can find what

the crass among us call garden dwarves, dwarves turned to stone by

sunlight and cursed to spend eternity as statues. The poor souls are often

surrounded by offerings of family members who take pilgrimages to see

them when night fully falls.

Quest: Dwarven craftmasters are regarded as the most skilled in all the

Icelands, and the new overseer of a multi-settlement compact seeks a

    Sure, everyone wants their greatest wishes to come true, but you should

    never trust a fossegrim to do it. The fossegrim are capricious water spirits

    that enjoy making odd contracts with people to fulfill their wish once

    payment has been made. However, rare are the stories where this wish

    fulfillment has occurred in the way the wisher envisioned it. Most times,

    the wish being fulfilled only adds to the tragedy.

    Fossegrim like to frequent streams and waterways that widen around a

    small middle island where they can sit and play their fiddle. The music is

    like a siren's call to some, particularly the brokenhearted and desperate.

    The water imps are always courteous and give every indication that they

    will indeed fulfill a person's greatest wish. They promise it all will turn out

    exactly as they word their wish and warn to word it carefully. Because of

    this, there's always someone who thinks they have the words to outwit a

The gnomes are far more elemental creatures of darkness than the elves or

their newest treasures, talking to the objects and caressing them like a pet.

As creatures of a more primordial make-up, one might think the gnomes

stupid, but this is far from true. They can be motivated by treasure to act

as scouts, spies, and manipulators who are quite effective at their trade.

Some claim that this shows the gnomes as descendants not only of trolls

but of the god Loki.

Quest: Multiple objects had gone missing during the nights around the

settlement of Oakcrest before a small cave opening was discovered in the

nearby woods. The people think that gnomes may be responsible for the

thefts and want their things back, but they also know that the deep places

    The huldra truly are a sapient force of nature more than anything else.

    Their desires, thought process, and morality are so alien to our own that it

    is the very essence of chaos to interact with them. One moment they be a

    passionate lover and the next a cruel executioner dependent upon their

    whims and strange desires.

    What we know of these creatures is scant, but we believe they have the

    ability to drain the life energy from a living creature to sustain their own

    existence. Because they view themselves are guardians of nature itself,

    they rarely drain the life of plants or woodland animals. They by far prefer

    us, the Icelanders, for we are viewed as outsiders spoiling their domain.

    That and we make compatible lovers at least while we yet have life in us.

    From our viewpoint, the huldra are the ultimate hedonists and a grave

    danger. They cannot be reasoned with, cannot be taught to respect all

The jotnar are giant brutes who revel in chaos, turmoil, and strife. They

fight amongst themselves for pleasure and will destroy whole caravans

without taking any of the spoils just for the thrill of destruction.

The jotnar mostly inhabit the Jotunheim region and some of the southern

parts of Asgard. They are impervious to the cold in the Icelands and can

even be found out in the open during a snowstorm sleeping off a night's

revelry and entertainment. They have also been known to start avalanches

for fun and even ride them down the mountainside.

While the jotnar are not large enough to cause the region-wide earthquakes

that frequently occur in Jotunheim, one can understand how their

forebearers may have been large enough to do so.

Quest:An expedition toAsgard was cut short by a group of boulder tossing

jotnar. So accurate are their throws that some people were left alive with

appendages trapped under the boulders. The survivors are begging for

help as those who are still trapped may only have hours left before the cold

or their injuries kill them. That is, if the jotnar didn't come back. What

experience have you had with jotnar in the past that makes you feel

qualified to help?

YOUR TRUTH

Were the jotnar once a fuller and richer culture? If so, what

caused them to turn into the brutes they now are?

    At first glance, one might consider the Ljosalfar, or Gold Elves, as the

    "good" elves and the Dokkalfar as the "bad" elves, but this is a primitive

    view of the actual situation. It is true that the Ljosalfar are far less likely

    to kill you if you meet them in a dark section of the forest, but they can be

    just as ruthless if pushed. They do not grant outsiders access to their

    settlements easily, and they cavalierly enforce what they call the Laws of

    Nature with immediate death sentences for those who violate it.

    Their nightly revels are legendary for their extravagance and opulence, but

    they too are a trap. If an Icelander were to find their way to a nightly revel,

    they would be lost to the realm of mortals. We don't know if the revels are

    true events or merely part of the elves'illusory powers to trick us.

    The Ljosalfar wear masked forged from gold that are said to contain the

    essence of a single ray of sun cast through a facet of a great diamond set at

    the top of the tallest tree converted to a tower in their main settlement.

    These masks supposedly act as a focal point for their mysticism, and masks

    that we have found have also been used as foci for our mystics.

    Quest: A contingent of Ljosalfar say that the settlement of Eaglesham has

    encroached too far into the forest of the Alfheim. They have given the

    settlement until dusk tomorrow to remove the building frame recently

    erected and replace the trees that were felled there. If their instructions are

    not followed, Eaglesham is to be purged. Who do you know that may be

    able to regrow trees overnight? What will it take to get them to Eaglesham

    in time?

Like the dwarves, the cave trolls of the Icelands also turn to stone in the

sunlight. But where the dwarves provide exquisite craftsmanship, the

trolls only take. They are generally selfish and more animalistic in nature

leading them to take whatever they want if they are strong enough to do so.

Their thick skin acts as a natural armor, almost as if their skin is partially

turned to stone already. Their favorite strategy is wait in darkness, spark

the end of an explosively bright torch, and pummel their flash-blinded prey

with their flaming brand. They never worry about defending themselves as

they trust their own hides to protect them and know that they can

regenerate quickly.

If they are outdoors when they attack, they enjoy pushing whole trees down

on top of their opponents. Their strength can only be outmatched by a

jotnar, and their long arms give them a longer reach than any other.

Quest: Three trolls were said to be turned to stone as they argued over

which of their Icelander captives to eat first. Now the survivors of that

ordeal want to go back and hunt for the trolls'lair thinking they may find

some easy treasure, but the area is riddled with deep caves. What treasure

in particular did the trolls take from someone you know?

    The disir are another example of the cruelty of the Ljosalfar. We believe

    these spectral warriors are ancestors of the elves set to guard their most

    sacred locations from all but the most devout. They generally attack on

    sight and cannot be dissuaded from their task. Our best weapon against

    them is that we can run away because they will not leave their site of power

    unguarded even for a moment.

    Those who are touched by a disir experience a withering of their flesh in

    that area. We call it the death touch. You can tell when someone has had

    an encounter with a disir and survived because of the necrotic pocks where

    the ghastly creatures touched them even if they were armored at the time.

    Quest: A new road is being built between two settlements but the route they

    chose passes near a site guarded by several disir. However, if they move

    the road further one direction, it will run through elven territory, and

The draugar are corpses inhabited by spiteful spirits guarding their own

tomb or resting place. Usually the draugar are spawned when a particularly

greedy person is buried with a significant amount of their own treasure

which they then guard zealously. This is where we get the phrase, "Never

bury a king with his gold."

The draugar can increase their size at a moment's notice rivaling the stature

of a troll and somehow have the ability to shift through stone and earth

despite their corporeal nature. No one visits crypts anymore lest the arms

of a draugar reach through the wall and grab them followed by a deadly

bite when the draugar begins to suck their blood.

Luckily, we have found a reliable way to deal with draugar. If one can be

wrestled back to their own grave and held there while the words of power

are recited, their spirits can finally be put to rest. However, there are few

brave or foolish enough to take on a quest such as this.

Quest: Despite protestations from the citizens, the greedy overseer Hroarr

was buried in an extravagant ceremony. This was seen as a political move

on the part of the next overseer to pacify Hroarr's former henchmen. Now

"disappoint the old man." How do you know this new overseer? What

    Mares comes from the word nightmare, but mares exist in the real world

    outside of the dreamer's mind. It is said that when a person's soul reaches

    the depths of apathy or hopelessness with life, the soul will stray from its

    body while the body sleeps. Have you awakened from a full night's rest

    that was undisturbed yet still feel bone-weary? Take stock of your life, for

    your soul may be turning into a mare.

    When a mare leaves its body, it wanders nearby trying to arouse fear in

    others which in turn feed its energy. The stronger the mare gets, the longer

    the person sleeps until eventually they don't wake up again.

    Beyond seeking out fear, the mares will often act out inappropriate

    behaviors that the person can't do while they are awake. The mare may

    harass a family member they find annoying, seek revenge on a former

    lover, or even cause pain and harm for fun.

    But not all is lost when a mare is formed for we know how to dissuade their

    reappearance: stories of valor and noble purpose. You need not a mystic if

    you have a troubled soul. You need a skald, a bard who can spin the yarns

    of faith, hope and love. This is is not only good for removing the threat of

    the mare but also for the person that formed the mare.

    Quest: The entire settlement of Springbrook believes that they each are

    projecting mares at night because it is taking them all longer and longer to

    Do mares truly come and go each night as they increase in

At times the Valkyrie were lauded as positive protectors, but now that

we've seen them up close in the Icelands, we know better. The Valkyrie

are actually bloodthirsty warrior spirits wrapped in flames who seek

nothing but battle after battle and deaths beyond counting.

TheValkyrie are said to fly over significant battles and stir emotions to ever

higher frenzies. They seek out the mightiest warrior on the field and do

battle with that person themselves. Once theValkyrie are noted, it is wisest

for both sides of the battle to sue for peace immediately, but rarely does this

occur like it should.

Legend says that the reason the Valkyrie seek out so much death is because

they use the souls of the mightiest warriors to weave together specific

fabrics of fate that they then pass on to the Norn. And what would the

Valkyries want to be the destiny of the Icelands? More battles. More

death. More power for themselves.

We don't believe a Valkyrie can be truly killed, but there have been

warriors strong enough to best them in battle. When that happens, the fire

spirits flee and usually are not seen for weeks or even months.

Quest: The renowned warrior Torvald seeks to test his mettle against a

Valkyrie. To call forth the fiery spirits, he has gathered a small army to

march on a raider stronghold. Torvald believes he can best the Valkyrie

and help the people at the same time. You know something about the leader

of the raiders that Torvald does not. What is it, and how will it effect his

plan for battle poorly?

Are Valkyrie guided by some divine figure, or are they merely

the next in a long line of horrors?

    USING RUNES AS ORACLES

    To increase your immersion in the Norse mythology, you may also try

    using the Elder Futhark runes as your oracle. The Elder Futhark are a runic

    Norse alphabet of 24 letters dating back to the 5th century AD. Each rune

    has a name, a literal interpretation, and broader connotations that were and

    still are used for divination purposes. Some have also used a 25th blank

    rune to represent Odin and knowledge that is not yet ready to be known.

    Since we'll be using percentile tables, that will fit nicely!

    One interpretation of the Elder Futhark rune reading method splits the

    runes into three major sections or families called Aetts. Each family has

    eight runes within it and can generally represent three stages of a life

    journey (beginning, middle, and end) and are ruled by a specific god

    (Freyr, Heimdall, and Tyr).

    ASK THE ORACLE

    We can use the three categories as an Ask the Oracle replacement. Since

    Freyr is the goddess of peace (Yes), Heimdall is the watchman (Neutral),

    and Tyr the god of war (No), roll percentile dice three times using the

    following table and look at the broad categories for the runes to answer

    yes/no questions. Any Yes (Freyr) and No (Tyr) pair of runes cancel each

    other out while Neutral (Heimdall) runes do not affect the answer.

    Whatever the majority category of leftover runes are will be our answer.

    (I'm assuming it's a 50/50 likelihood for basic interpretation.)

Tiwaz     Berkana   Ehwaz  Mannaz   Laguz            Ingwaz  Othala  Dagaz

*Note that rolling 97-00 would be our Odin blank rune.

For example, say we rolled for runes (tables coming up shortly) and got

three Freyr runes. The answer would be an emphatic Yes (like yes with a

match). If we got two Tyr and one Freyr, the one Freyr would cancel one

of the Tyr leaving us with a single No rune, so the answer is No. If we got

two Heimdall and one Freyr, the answer is Yes since the neutral do not

affect the answer.

If we get one of each category, the Freyr and Tyr cancel leaving us with a

Neutral answer in which case you split the difference of the meaning within

your story if you can. For example, say you were asking the oracle if there

was an exit to the room and got a final answer of only Heimdall. Then yes,

there is an exit, but it's not usable. Yes and No.

To get answers for other likelihoods other than 50/50, remove one rune of

the opposite direction for each step in the likelihood. Yeah, I know. That

sentence doesn't make sense. Check this out:

Likelihood          Directions for Casting Runes

Small Chance        If possible, remove two Yes runes before interpreting.

Unlikely            If possible, remove one Yes rune before interpreting.

50/50               Interpret the result as normal.

Likely              If possible, remove one No rune before interpreting.

Almost Certain If possible, remove two No runes before interpreting.

    Again, let's run through a quick example to clarify how to do this.

    Say we wanted to Ask the Oracle whether or not an enemy has advanced

    knowledge of our plan with a likelihood of Small Chance. Rolling on the

    above table gives we get:

    F (Freyr/Yes), þ (Freyr/Yes),  (Heimdall/Neutral)

    Small Chance says to remove two Yes runes and then interpret, meaning

    we are down to just Neutral as the answer. We can interpret this to mean

    the enemy has advanced knowledge of our plan, but that knowledge is

    faulty. They'll be prepared in general but not in the specifics.

    Had it been: Yes, No, Neutral, we would have only be able to remove one

    Yes leaving us with No and Neutral. That would have made the final

    answer No, the enemy has no advanced knowledge.

    The only way we could have gotten a final answer of Yes would have been

    to roll three Yes runes in a row.

    *Note: If you have physical runes in a bag that you are drawing, your

    probabilities will change slightly since you won't replace the runes.

    However, this method should still be usable.

    ACTION/THEME ORACLE

    We can also use the runes to replace an Action/Theme roll in Ironsworn.

    To do so, we'll again roll percentile three times to get three runes that

    represent action, theme, and modifier. While this is not a traditional way

    of interpreting the runes, I'm taking a common three-rune casting and

    making it fit our Ironsworn structure. I'm not attempting to teach you

    actual divination practices nor insult those traditions, just giving you a cool

    way to play a game!

    In addition to the three runes we'll roll for, you can also look for which of

    three categories the runes fall in. If the three runes you roll all come from

    the sameAett (Freyr, Heimdall, orTyr), you may consider that like a match

    on the challenge dice which intensifies the degree of your interpretation of

    the runes. However, remember that typically anAction/Theme roll doesn't

    deal with matches, so it's up to you if you want to introduce that mechanic.

    Roll percentile three times on the following table:

    A SAMPLE ACTION/THEME/MODIFIER ROLL

    Bataar is trying to track down his warrior sister who went out alone to hunt

    down a terrible beast. We first Gather Information to try to get some

    bearings on which way she may have gone and score a strong hit. But what

    exactly did Bataar find out? Let's cast the runes. Rolling percentile three

    times yields the following results:

    Action: 8 - u Uruz (Freyr) - Strength, endurance, health, courage

    Theme: 26 - G Gebo (Freyr) - Generosity, partnership, gifts

    Modifier: 86 -  Ingwaz (Tyr) - Pregnancy, inner growth, virtue, peace

    It looks like Bataar's sister took bold action (uruz). She went someplace

    that would take endurance and strength to reach. Wherever she went also

    involved a generous gift (gebo). Putting those two things, maybe she

    didn't go directly after the beast, but instead she decided to first seek out

    the Faith Tester, a priest of Thor, who is guardian to a lightning-shaped

    dagger called Storm's Gift that was forged using Thor's own hammer.

    The priest tests the faith of those who seek him out through a series of

    grueling challenges. Those found worthy are given Storm's Gift to wield

    for one week, one day, and one hour. If not returned, the bearer of Storm's

    Gift falls under a terrible curse.

    The third rune (ingwaz) reveals that perhaps Bataar's sister sees her quest

    as one about spiritual growth more than stopping the beast. While that's all

    well and good, that means that the rampaging beast is free to deal out more

    destruction while his sister seeks out the iron priest.

    In my story, Bataar put this together through some conversations with

    people around the settlement stemming from the strong hit on the Gather

    Information roll. Now he faces a choice: does Bataar continue the search

    for his sister to aid and support her in her quest, or does he go after the beast

    himself to prevent it from causing more harm in the meantime?
