    USING RUNES AS ORACLES
    To increase your immersion in the Norse mythology, you may also try
    using the Elder Futhark runes as your oracle. The Elder Futhark are a runic
    Norse alphabet of 24 letters dating back to the 5th century AD. Each rune
    has a name, a literal interpretation, and broader connotations that were and
    still are used for divination purposes. Some have also used a 25th blank
    rune to represent Odin and knowledge that is not yet ready to be known.
    Since we'll be using percentile tables, that will fit nicely!
    One interpretation of the Elder Futhark rune reading method splits the
    runes into three major sections or families called Aetts. Each family has
    eight runes within it and can generally represent three stages of a life
    journey (beginning, middle, and end) and are ruled by a specific god
    (Freyr, Heimdall, and Tyr).
    ASK THE ORACLE
    We can use the three categories as an Ask the Oracle replacement. Since
    Freyr is the goddess of peace (Yes), Heimdall is the watchman (Neutral),
    and Tyr the god of war (No), roll percentile dice three times using the
    following table and look at the broad categories for the runes to answer
    yes/no questions. Any Yes (Freyr) and No (Tyr) pair of runes cancel each
    other out while Neutral (Heimdall) runes do not affect the answer.
    Whatever the majority category of leftover runes are will be our answer.
    (I'm assuming it's a 50/50 likelihood for basic interpretation.)

*Note that rolling 97-00 would be our Odin blank rune.
For example, say we rolled for runes (tables coming up shortly) and got
three Freyr runes. The answer would be an emphatic Yes (like yes with a
match). If we got two Tyr and one Freyr, the one Freyr would cancel one
of the Tyr leaving us with a single No rune, so the answer is No. If we got
two Heimdall and one Freyr, the answer is Yes since the neutral do not
affect the answer.
If we get one of each category, the Freyr and Tyr cancel leaving us with a
Neutral answer in which case you split the difference of the meaning within
your story if you can. For example, say you were asking the oracle if there
was an exit to the room and got a final answer of only Heimdall. Then yes,
there is an exit, but it's not usable. Yes and No.
To get answers for other likelihoods other than 50/50, remove one rune of
the opposite direction for each step in the likelihood. Yeah, I know. That
sentence doesn't make sense. Check this out:
Likelihood          Directions for Casting Runes
Small Chance        If possible, remove two Yes runes before interpreting.
Unlikely            If possible, remove one Yes rune before interpreting.
50/50               Interpret the result as normal.
Likely              If possible, remove one No rune before interpreting.
Almost Certain If possible, remove two No runes before interpreting.

    Again, let's run through a quick example to clarify how to do this.
    Say we wanted to Ask the Oracle whether or not an enemy has advanced
    knowledge of our plan with a likelihood of Small Chance. Rolling on the
    above table gives we get:
    F (Freyr/Yes), � (Freyr/Yes),  (Heimdall/Neutral)
    Small Chance says to remove two Yes runes and then interpret, meaning
    we are down to just Neutral as the answer. We can interpret this to mean
    the enemy has advanced knowledge of our plan, but that knowledge is
    faulty. They'll be prepared in general but not in the specifics.
    Had it been: Yes, No, Neutral, we would have only be able to remove one
    Yes leaving us with No and Neutral. That would have made the final
    answer No, the enemy has no advanced knowledge.
    The only way we could have gotten a final answer of Yes would have been
    to roll three Yes runes in a row.
    *Note: If you have physical runes in a bag that you are drawing, your
    probabilities will change slightly since you won't replace the runes.
    However, this method should still be usable.
    ACTION/THEME ORACLE
    We can also use the runes to replace an Action/Theme roll in Ironsworn.
    To do so, we'll again roll percentile three times to get three runes that
    represent action, theme, and modifier. While this is not a traditional way
    of interpreting the runes, I'm taking a common three-rune casting and
    making it fit our Ironsworn structure. I'm not attempting to teach you
    actual divination practices nor insult those traditions, just giving you a cool
    way to play a game!
    In addition to the three runes we'll roll for, you can also look for which of
    three categories the runes fall in. If the three runes you roll all come from
    the sameAett (Freyr, Heimdall, orTyr), you may consider that like a match
    on the challenge dice which intensifies the degree of your interpretation of
    the runes. However, remember that typically anAction/Theme roll doesn't
    deal with matches, so it's up to you if you want to introduce that mechanic.
    Roll percentile three times on the following table:

A SAMPLE ACTION/THEME/MODIFIER ROLL
    Bataar is trying to track down his warrior sister who went out alone to hunt
    down a terrible beast. We first Gather Information to try to get some
    bearings on which way she may have gone and score a strong hit. But what
    exactly did Bataar find out? Let's cast the runes. Rolling percentile three
    times yields the following results:
    Action: 8 - u Uruz (Freyr) - Strength, endurance, health, courage
    Theme: 26 - G Gebo (Freyr) - Generosity, partnership, gifts
    Modifier: 86 -  Ingwaz (Tyr) - Pregnancy, inner growth, virtue, peace
    It looks like Bataar's sister took bold action (uruz). She went someplace
    that would take endurance and strength to reach. Wherever she went also
    involved a generous gift (gebo). Putting those two things, maybe she
    didn't go directly after the beast, but instead she decided to first seek out
    the Faith Tester, a priest of Thor, who is guardian to a lightning-shaped
    dagger called Storm's Gift that was forged using Thor's own hammer.
    The priest tests the faith of those who seek him out through a series of
    grueling challenges. Those found worthy are given Storm's Gift to wield
    for one week, one day, and one hour. If not returned, the bearer of Storm's
    Gift falls under a terrible curse.
    The third rune (ingwaz) reveals that perhaps Bataar's sister sees her quest
    as one about spiritual growth more than stopping the beast. While that's all
    well and good, that means that the rampaging beast is free to deal out more
    destruction while his sister seeks out the iron priest.
    In my story, Bataar put this together through some conversations with
    people around the settlement stemming from the strong hit on the Gather
    Information roll. Now he faces a choice: does Bataar continue the search
    for his sister to aid and support her in her quest, or does he go after the beast
    himself to prevent it from causing more harm in the meantime?
    RUNE STONES
    If you like the idea of using runes, you might check out a set of stone dice
    with runes that a fellow Ironsworn player, Ferrite, made available here:
    https://www.etsy.com/uk/listing/993522866/stone-rune-dice-set-of-6
    They also made a way to interpret the runes and made it available in the
    Share Your Kit channel of the Ironsworn Discord. Check it out!
