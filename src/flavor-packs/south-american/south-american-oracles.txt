IV  THE JUNGLELANDS | BASED ON SOUTH AMERICAN MYTHOLOGY
THE JUNGLELANDS

Inspired by South American Mythologies

IRONSMITH: FLAVOR PACKS                 1
   THE JUNGLELANDS

   Each Flavor Pack for the Ironsworn RPG is inspired by some culture's

   mythology. The ideas presented are not exact duplicates of myths,

   cultures, or creatures from those cultures, but rather are general ideas

   meant to evoke a slightly different feeling rather than the viking-like

   setting of the Ironsworn core setting.

   The Junglelands Flavor Pack was inspired by mythologies from across

   SouthAmerica and Mesoamerica, particularly the Inca andAztec.

   The southern continent that the Junglelanders came from was

   rapidly spinning into a new ice age which forced the people to flee

   to the north hoping to find warmer and more hospitable climates.

   When they first landed in the Junglelands, they thought they had

   succeeded at both, but it was a paradise too good to be true. The

   oppressive heat, constant cycle of tropical storms, and dangerous

   animal life makes this a harsh land to call home.

   At first there were few enough people that hunting and gathering

   provided for their needs, but that too rapidly changed. All manner

   of dangerous creatures lurking in the jungles viewed them as

   invaders and prey. Thus, farming suddenly became a part of every

   warrior's job, but it is difficult tending to the crops when you can

   have only one hand on the plow since the other must hold a

   weapon to fend off the various threats of the land.

   The Junglelands continent is a study in extremes. It goes from the

   driest desert on the coastal plains to the wettest rain forest

   surrounding rich river basins, from the flattest of plains to the

   highest mountain peaks. These extremely different environments

   have given rise to an equally diverse set of flora, fauna, and

   monstrous beasts that roam the lands.

   In addition, the Junglelanders were not the first to settle on this

   continent. Ancient and magnificent ruins are scattered throughout

   the lands as well as immense carved stone statues, obelisks, and

   altars. These may be from the firstborn people rumored to still be

   living in the Junglelands or possibly from some more ancient

   people.

   Life in the Junglelands is hard. Survival is the watch word, and the

   traditions and customs of their ancestors are at times all that keep

   the Junglelanders from giving up hope of taming this wild place.

2  THE JUNGLELANDS | BASED ON SOUTH AMERICAN MYTHOLOGY
NEW REGIONS

Each region in the Junglelands corresponds to a region on the normal

Ironsworn map. In this way, you can continue to use the same map while

still getting a new flavor for the setting.

The original Ironsworn regions change as follows:

1. Barrier Islands  Rumi Uma Wat'a (Stone Head Isles)

2. Ragged Coast  Kiru Chhukruna (The Toothed Beak)

3. Deep Wilds  Unu Sach'ara (The Drowning Wood)

4. Flooded Lands  Thuniy Nan (The Shattered Road)

5. Havens  Chinka Wayta Pata (The Lost Garden)

6. Hinterlands  Q'umirAmaru Pikchu (The Green Snake Hills)

7. Tempest Hills  Qincha Phaqcha (Wall of Waterfalls)

8. Veiled Mountains  Yana Hirka (The Obsidian Mountains)

9. Shattered Wastes  P'uruna T'urr (The Sinking Plains of Mud)

IRONSMITH: FLAVOR PACKS                                                 3
   RUMI UMA WAT'A                                        STONE HEAD ISLES

   Replaces: Barrier Islands (Region 1)

   Features:

   · Stone heads rising out of or           · Sporadic patches of trees with

   sinking back into the ground             shallow roots

   · Grassy coastal plains exposed          · Constant wind

   to the elements                          · Violently crashing waves

   The Rumi UmaWat'a islands are covered with large stone heads that do not

   appear to have been carved but formed organically, and most people claim

   that the islands are cursed. The legend goes that the first inhabitants were

   formed of the earth of these isles by Sachamama, the snake deity of the

   jungle. They rebelled against the Mother Snake, and she cursed them to

   slowly sink back to the earth from whence they came.

   The few Junglelanders who make their home here hurriedly try to fish

   between the almost non-stop hurricanes. Again demonstrating their

   mystical quality, the stones heads serve as anchors for shelters and are far

   more likely to survive the hurricane force winds than shelters not

   incorporating the stone heads.

   The islands are also home to large or

   mutated animals that are not present

   on the mainland. This is most likely

   due to the nature of the plants on

   these islands which have adapted to

   survive the terrible winds. Trees that

   grow here have very shallow and

   wide root systems and are extremely

   flexible. Leaves, bark, and even the

   wood of tree trunks are full of thick

   cords that our stomachs cannot

   digest, but the odd creatures here

   have evolved to eat these rope-like

   strands     that  are    almost     as

   indestructible as iron.

   Quest: One stone head has a bright

   green    jewel    embedded      in  its

   forehead. What power does this gem

   have, and what dangerous creature

   guards it?

4         THE JUNGLELANDS | BASED ON SOUTH AMERICAN MYTHOLOGY
KIRU CHHUKRUNA                                   THE TOOTHED BEAK

Replaces: Ragged Coast (Region 2)

Features:

· Waves crashing against           · Drums sounding as

sheer rock cliffs                  pirates near

· The creak of wood rubbing   on   · Nets marking fish breeding and

wood as houses float               feeding pools

The coastal region of Kiru Chhukruna is said to have formed when

Huayramama, the snake deity of the wind, cast the great alicanto bird Quri

Apu from the sky after the bird dared to shine brighter than her.This is why

the alicanto birds no longer fly. As Quri Apu fell, her beak shattered into

the teeth of the coast. Those teeth form steep rocky drop-offs to the sea

from the jungle interior.

Because of the extreme jagged nature of the coast, Junglelanders here live

mainly on floating wooden houses and pray that the Rumi Uma Wat'a

protect them from the onslaught of storms. In particularly calm bays,

several families may bind together their houses forming a tiny floating

village. Unfortunately, these places are easy prey for pirates and raiders on

prowling the coastal waters.

Due to the frequency of storms, larger boats and ships are rarely built

except by risk-taking pirates. More common are the low canoes made to

maintain their balance even in the roughest waves as long as they are

guided by a skilled pilot.

Quest: A small settlement lacking the warriors to protect themselves had

their floating village pulled out to the open sea by pirates who are

demanding crates of fish and other supplies as a ransom. A quick-thinking

youth jumped into the sea before they were pulled too far out, swam to

shore, and now seeks help to save the village. Who do you know there?

IRONSMITH: FLAVOR PACKS                                                        5
   UNU SACH'ARA                     THE DROWNING WOOD

   Replaces: Deep Wilds (Region 3)

   Features:

   · Small streams feeding the      · Towering trees of

   Mayu Wanu                        exceptional girth

   · Thick, hanging vines           · Steamy humidity

   · Constant hoots and howls       · Ever-present patter of rain

   Unu Sach'ara is a dense tropical rain forest with deep rivers all flowing into

   the larger Mayu Wanu, the River of Death. The jungles here hide small

   conclaves of firstborn, and the rivers house flesh-eating fish and snakes.

   The constant cacophony, particularly the animal screams at night, have

   been known to drive more than one Junglelander mad.

   Junglelanders have deforested the edges of this untamed rain forest to

   make their homes, but it is said that any tree felled for greed rather than

   need will lead to a grim meeting with Sachamama. While one of the most

   dangerous places on the continent, Junglelanders still risk venturing into

   the region for the exotic plants and herbs that only grow here.

   Quest: The savior flower only blooms every handful of years and is set to

   bloom this year. The pedals of this miraculous plant can be used in a

   healing poultice that cures nearly all injuries and diseases. Unfortunately,

   the trek to the area where the savior flower grows is arduous and fraught

   with peril. What need sends you on this dangerous quest for the savior

   flower?

6  THE JUNGLELANDS | BASED ON SOUTH AMERICAN MYTHOLOGY
THUNIY NAN                             THE SHATTERED ROAD

Replaces: Flooded Lands (Region 4)

Features:

· Roar of waters falling               · Gaping holes in rocks leading

into sinkholes                         to only darkness below

· Dark slabs of rock impervious        · Sparse forests

to pickaxes and other tools            · Bogs and swamps

Thuniy Nan is where the great river MayuWanu meets its early end. Rather

than flowing on to the sea, small but deep sink holes dot the land forcing

the river to split again and again into smaller streams. Moreover, a specific

mineral in the rocks is immune to the ravages of water erosion, again

making the river split in odd places.

Great surges of sea water push far inland before mixing with the river

water. It is said there are underground cave networks that allow the river

water to finally get to the ocean and that large alligator people guard these

passages.

Junglelanders living here try to take advantage of the rampant death of

aquatic creatures when salt water and fresh water mix without running

afoul of the more dangerous varieties who can live in either.

Quest: At the very end of the Mayu Wanu lies a great sinkhole creating a

large whirlpool within sight of the ocean. Legend says that a great

underground city can only be accessed by going down the whirlpool. What

does the legend say is contained in this city, and why do you need it?

IRONSMITH: FLAVOR PACKS                                                        7
   CHINKA WAYTA PATA                           THE LOST GARDEN

   Replaces: Havens (Region 5)

   Features:

   · Heat radiating from the sun               · Settlements built up in the

   and the trees                               rocky tree branches

   · Layers of vines covering                  · Mayu Wanu running swiftly

   everything in sight                         with deep, dark waters

   Chinka Wayta Pata was supposed to be the saving grace for the

   Junglelanders. The Mayu Wanu provided a steady source of water, and the

   tropical gardens growing in the river basin valleys yielded sustenance and

   supplies for building shelters to live in.

   Unfortunately, what looked like forests in this region were really trees that

   had been turned to stone in some cataclysm far in the past. Rocky stumps

   and even full-grown trees of rock spread out across the landscape and act

   as heat traps for the sun's rays.As such, they provide little respite from the

   sweltering heat of the Junglelands. Some species of vines are capable of

   withstanding the heat and grow over the rocks, but most new tree growth

   has a hard time finding purchase.

   Still, the Junglelanders persist, for this is their best option for survival. The

   soil between the rocky trees can still be used as small garden patches, and

   there is always the River of Death to fish if you can survive the aquatic

   denizens.

   Quest: A group of stubborn Junglelanders have decided to clear an area of

   the rocky trees to build a settlement rather than using them as the

   foundation. The work is tiresome and dangerous with the raiders known to

   be at large. What makes the group of raiders hard to track, and who do

   owe a favor to that you agreed to help build this new settlement?

8  THE JUNGLELANDS | BASED ON SOUTH AMERICAN MYTHOLOGY
Q'UMIR AMARU PIKCHU               THE GREEN SNAKE HILLS

Replaces: Hinterlands (Region 6)

Features:

· Beautiful flowering trees       · Animals feasting together

· Colorful clouds of pollen       on fallen fruit

constantly churning               · Settlements built on high

· Tall, yellow grasses rustling   wooden beams above the fog

Q'umir Amaru Pikchu is filled with gently rolling hills of tall grasses and

numerous fruit trees that are almost always flowering. However, many of

the fruit trees in this region are as poisonous to humans as the bite of a

viper. Worse, the animal life has adapted to the fruit and inadvertently help

spread the poison through the water sources of the region via the seeds left

in their spoor.

When one of these trees begins its flowering cycle anew, its pollen spores

create vibrant clouds of poison that travel for miles in a dense fog.

Junglelanders have settled here but always carry a miyu hampiy, meaning

poison cure, that is made by distilling the crushed leaves of a rare purple

fern known as kulli raki.

Each settlement has a group of gatherers assigned daily to find more of the

protective plant which is then turned into miyu hampiy and stockpiled for

when the poison storms blow through. The gatherers must also be

protected by warriors because of the number of aggressive species of

animals in the area.

Quest: Something is killing off the kulli raki near the settlement of Corpa

forcing gatherers to go farther afield to find the plant. What is killing off

the fern locally, and can enough kulli raki be found before the next large

poison storm arrives?

IRONSMITH: FLAVOR PACKS                                                        9
    QINCHA PHAQCHA                                  THE WALL OF WATERFALLS

    Replaces: Tempest Hills (Region 7)

    Features:

    · Sheer, black cliff faces          · Rugged hills leading to cliffs

    · Gray slabs of rock                · Water running steadily towards

    · Thunder of waterfalls             the distant Mayu Wanu

    · Holes dotting the cliffs          · Scavengers flying overhead

    The region of Qincha Phaqcha is known for its many waterfalls dropping

    off the sheer cliffs of the Yana Hirka mountains. One of the most

    spectacular sites is the Lunq'u Falls where a semi-circle of over 200

    waterfalls cascade down jagged cliffs spitting blinding amounts of spray

    into the air.

    Junglelanders in this region mostly live in the forests and hills to the

    immediate south of the waterfall cliffs, but some build dwellings directly

    into the cliff faces and fish with great nets at the waterfall mouths.

    Agricultural work is nearly impossible for the settlements within the cliff

    faces, so the residents grow mushrooms and other fungi within their cave

    dwellings in the rock. Furthermore, the area surrounding the waterfalls and

    cliffs is universally rock with no trees in sight for a handful of miles south

    meaning dangerous treks must be made to haul lumber back for building

    staircases, supports, and platforms within the cliff dwellings.

    Even in the southern hills and forest, this region is still a harsh area to call

    home as it is teeming with dangerous wildlife.

    Quest: The cliff dwelling community of Temutaro tunneled deep within the

    cliff face that they live in and discovered a strange ore. What unusual

    properties does this ore have, and why is it dangerous enough that the

    overseer is worried about it causing a panic?

10  THE JUNGLELANDS | BASED ON SOUTH AMERICAN MYTHOLOGY
YANA HIRKA                             THE OBSIDIAN MOUNTAINS

Replaces: Veiled Mountains (Region 8)

Features:

· Mountain passes ever changing        · Shrieks of creatures who rule

with powerful quakes                   in the darkness

· Sounds of falling rock echoing       · Vibrations in tunnel walls

through dark tunnels                   · Sudden rock slides

The Yana Hirka mountain range is so named because of the rare veins of

black iron that streak through them. Nearly every vein is strangely

cylindrical and most of them flow back towards a single origin point deep

under the mountains. Despite efforts to find the convergence point of these

veins, none have been able to break through due to an area of solid

diamond surrounding it. Speculations run wild of a "beating heart" within

the mountains.

The greatest of Junglelander warriors have their wooden macuahuitls lined

with the dark ore from these veins giving the weapons phenomenal

strength and razor sharp edges. However, finding a safe place to mine for

the rare black iron is difficult with the constant threat of firstborn nearby

and the many denizens in the dark underground spaces.

Moreover, the mountain range itself is no stranger to earthquakes that are

said to cause the peaks to gain up to 20 feet in height in just a few seconds.

One day, there may be a clear passage to the closest mining ground, and the

next that passage may be shut off by the shifting of rock during a quake.

Quest: A group of miners was due back with a shipment of black iron over

a week ago. Why do you need to find one of the miners in particular, and

what makes the mine they were working significantly more dangerous than

most?

IRONSMITH: FLAVOR PACKS                                                         11
    P'URUNA T'URR                          THE SINKING PLAINS OF MUD

    Replaces: Shattered Wastes (Region 9)

    Features:

    · Unending sea of mud                  · Blazing sun broken only by

    · Rotting carcasses of animals         sporadic mangrove trees

    trapped in the mire                    · Strange lights at night

    · Baying of distant creatures          beckoning you to follow

    The P'uruna T'uru is an endless wasteland of bog, mire and muck. No

    Junglelanders have dared to venture out into this region for fear of being

    resigned to a slow death of suffocation after being trapped in sucking mud.

    Despite the dangerous terrain, there must be safe passage somewhere in

    these lands for the call of animals and beasts can be heard out among the

    few mangrove-like trees that are scattered throughout the muck.The stench

    of death and decay hovers over this place as the uncountable number of

    animal carcasses caught in the mud rot in the hot sun before fully

    submerging. The tiny puddles of water that form in the mud often house

    small fish or eels that feast on the nearby corpses.

    There are creatures that have learned to adapt to this environment by

    evolving flat, wide feet to better distribute their weight on the swampy

    ground. While they look somewhat like deer, they are actually carnivores

    and said to be able to produce dancing lights with their short tails.

    Quest: A mystic is asking for a petrified bone from the mud pits of P'uruna

    T'uru claiming it will have properties of resistance to heat and water. Why

    does this type of protection peak your interest?

12  THE JUNGLELANDS | BASED ON SOUTH AMERICAN MYTHOLOGY
NEW ASSETS

Just as the terrain and regions are different in the Junglelands, so too are the

people and their skills. Here are some assets unique to the Junglelands.

COMBAT TALENTS

Junglelanders rely heavily on stone and wood weapons mainly spears,

clubs, darts, swords, bows, slings, and double-headed axes. While there

are copper and iron weapons made, they are rare. You might consider

renaming or at least changing the in-game appearance of any Ironsworn

core assets that utilize these weapons. Here are the Inca words for such

weapons:

·  Axe - Chiqtana

·  Bow - Wachina

·  Club - Waqtana

·  Dagger - Tuksina

·  Sling - Waraka

·  Spear - Chuki

IRONSMITH: FLAVOR PACKS                                                           13
    ATLATL

    In the Junglelands, it was a child

    who hit upon the design of the

    atlatl. Jealous of always being

    out-thrown with spears, the

    young warrior-in-training went

    about finding a way to extend

    their arms artificially to build

    more momentum on the throw.

    Thus, the atlatl was born.

    While the atlatl does not have

    quite the range of a long bow, it

    does have more power and can

    deal more damage because of

    the larger thickness of the darts.

    It is a favored weapon when

    hunting large game as it can also

    knock the target prone with a

    powerful enough strike.

    Design Notes: To represent the

    additional power of this weapon,

    the first ability allows you to Strike from range using +iron instead of

    +edge and inflict more damage for a cost of momentum loss. The "short

    distance" is intentionally vague so that you can decide if a foe is out of

    range or not.

    The second ability is similar to the Ironsworn core asset Blade-Bound, but

    you lose supply to deal more damage instead of enduring stress. This is

    meant to represent your dart either breaking or becoming unusable as it

    nearly impales your foe.

    The third ability showcases the hunting prowess of the atlatl. You can

    choose between a precision attack to take down your game (careful aim) or

    taking down the largest target in the herd (alpha strike) to get more supply.

    Quest: The Grand Hunt is taking place where each hunter is given only a

    single spear, dart, arrow, or other single use weapon of their choice to take

    out into the wilds on the hunt. Whoever brings back the largest kill wins

    the competition. The Grand Hunt is always performed right before winter

    sets in so that supplies can be built up for the settlement, but this year the

    game has been extraordinarily scarce. What is driving away the game in

    this region?

14          THE JUNGLELANDS | BASED ON SOUTH AMERICAN MYTHOLOGY
CHAMPI

The champi is a mace with a

star-shaped head to help it better

penetrate armor. While champi

are in essence clubs, the heavy

ends give it more deadly and

devastating uses.

The champi can also serve a

ceremonial purpose by denoting

authority. The more ornate the

champi,  the       higher  social

standing a warrior or ruler has.

In some cases, it is seen as a sign

of strength to have a champi that

is so opulent that it is impractical

or ineffective as an actual

weapon.

Design Notes: Most of this asset

is a mirror of the Thunder-

Bringer  asset     from    core

Ironsworn just in a different

order. The first ability here is your standard bell-ringer (Thunder-Bringer's

second ability), and the third ability is all about breaking stuff (Thunder-

Bringer's first ability). However, when your character breaks stuff with a

champi, it is usually in a show of power or authority.

The second ability is different fromThunder-Bringer and gives you another

way to get a hit with a match. This is meant to represent the dense weight

at the end of the mace dealing damage with extreme force. To be clear, the

total action value would be the result of your action die plus your stat (iron

in this case) plus any adds. Example: With iron of 3, a 4 showing on your

action die roll, and an add of +1 from something like a Secure an

Advantage, your action total is 8. If both the challenge dice are 5 or lower,

it would count as a strong hit with a match allowing you to deal additional

damage or bring about some other narrative consequence.

Quest: The Kallpa Champi, or Mace of Power, was buried with the great

warrior Awaq Huanca Huyhua. A recent earthquake opened up a yawning

sinkhole that swallowed his tomb which prompted a local mystic to have a

vision that yielded two warnings. First, Awaq will not be happy that his

grave was disturbed and is likely to return as a horror. Second, if Kallpa

Champi is found and wielded by an underground denizen, it would be

dangerous for the whole region. What makes you think the earthquake may

not have been natural, and what do you think lurks in the deep darkness

underground?

    LIWI

    Liwi are a set of weighted balls

    tied at the ends of between two

    and eight ropes used for hunting.

    The weights and rope lengths

    vary depending on the specific

    animal being hunted, but all

    have the same main function of

    tying up the animals legs or

    wings to bring them down to the

    ground.

    Skilled hunters can deal damage

    with their liwi usually in a three-

    balled method. The center ball

    is heavier and strikes the

    creature's leg with full force.

    Two smaller balls are pulled

    behind the lead ball to either side

    which then wrap around to

    entangle. This type of liwi is

    extremely effective with hunting

    the large rheas bird.

    Design Notes: The first ability is the entangling part of the bolas while the

    second allows you to also deal damage when you try to entangle your foe.

    Note that the entangling only works for foes of formidable or less as others

    would be strong enough to break through the bola ropes.

    The third ability represents the traditional use of the liwi in hunting with

    two approaches. In the first approach, you are hunting bigger game like

    deer which you can bring down with ease. In the second approach, you

    hunt birds and get an add +2, but birds don't provide as much meat as other

    game, so you only take +1 supply.

    Unrelated to the upgrades for this asset, you might make it possible to

    wield the liwi without throwing them in your narrative by using them

    almost like a flail. If your character prefers that method of fighting, you

    may consider it a deadly weapon (inflicting 2 harm). On a miss with a

    match or other bad circumstance, having a liwi rope get cut could be a good

    way to Pay the Price.

    Quest: When weighted with leather pouches instead of stone, the liwi are

    very useful in capturing the alicanto bird who is prized for their ability to

    hunt down iron ore and generate light with their bodies. A group of miners

    would like to train some alicanto birds to help them, and a local bird has

    just hatched their clutch of fledglings. Can the mother bird be subdued

    while the chicks are taken? Why might the miners'intentions not be pure?

MACUAHUITL

The macuahuitl is a thick

wooden      paddle  with   slots

around the edge where shards of

razor-like obsidian are mounted.

The weapon is capable of

slashing with the shards and

bludgeoning with the wide

wooden portion.

The     weapon      came   into

prominence in the Junglelands

when the raider Achik Ccahua

began using them. He used only

the thinnest shards of obsidian

so that when he slashed with the

edges, he could twist the paddle

and snap off the shards inside his

opponent. The wound sites from

these   attacks     would  often

become infected earning Achik

his nickname: the Viper.

Design Notes: The first ability represents the weapon's nickname as the

"obsidian chainsaw." You're trying to maim your foe permanently by

chopping off an appendage. You deal more damage with this Strike, but it

is harder to score a hit. Also note that every use of the ability will either

result in a strong hit with a match or a miss with a match. For example, if

you have an action total of 7 vs challenge dice of 1 and 8, the 1 becomes

an 8 making it a miss with a match. The second ability gives you an add to

this move.

The third ability can be a good way to gain the initiative back in order to

End the Fight as a weak hit counts as a strong hit. This is narratively meant

to be a less deadly way of subduing your foe as you simply stun and daze

them into submission. The Aztecs used this method for capturing foes

alive to take back for ritual sacrifices.

Quest: The warriors of Papata need more obsidian for their macuahuitls,

but the road to the mines in the far north mountains is long and dangerous.

What else do you hope to find on the journey north, and what reward are

the people of Papata offering you that motivates you to join the expedition?

    COMPANIONS

    To better fit the Junglelands setting, you may consider changing the Hawk

    companion asset to an eagle. Here are other companions found in the

    Junglelands.

    ALICANTO

    The alicanto are large, flightless

    birds about the size of a penguin

    that can eat different types of

    ore. Some species of alicanto

    only eat a specific type of metal

    such as gold, silver, or iron, and

    their feathers develop the same

    hue as their meals.

    What is most remarkable about

    the alicanto is their ability to find

    precious metals. If befriended

    and treated well, the alicanto

    help us to find the metals we

    need for smithing and other

    projects. However, if they are

    treated ill, they will use their

    natural ability to create light to

    blind you and run away. They

    start by turning on their glowing

    feathers to get your attention and

    lead you towards a cliff or

    precipice as their light dwindles ever lower.    You'll either  be lost in the  dark

    or dead from a fall off a cliff, so have a care  and treat the  alicanto you    meet

    with respect.

    Design Notes: The first ability is for when you take advantage of the

    alicanto's nose for metal. The second ability is similar except that it helps

    you specifically when you are ambushed. "Significant quantities" is

    intentionally vague to allow you wiggle room in your narrative.

    The third ability represents the idea that alicanto can create light within

    their feathers after eating ore. If you are using the Wealth track from the

    Fortune Hunter asset, you might consider suffering -1 wealth instead of -1

    supply when using this ability.

    Quest:Afaithful alicanto companion's reactions led a miner to believe that

    they had found a huge vein of precious ore. However, once the miner

    began digging in the new direction indicated by the alicanto, the bird

    became frantic and fled. It will no longer go down into the mine as if it

    fears for its life. What could the alicanto sense that the miner can't?

18  THE JUNGLELANDS | BASED ON SOUTH AMERICAN MYTHOLOGY
UTURUNKU

The uturunku of the Junglelands

are fierce apex predators who eat

strictly meat. They are brave

enough and capable enough to

attack alligators in the Mayu

Wanu and strong enough to

pierce the shells of river turtles.

Having an uturunku companion

in the Junglelands is extremely

rare and is considered a sign of

favor  from      the  gods  and

ancestors.   Because it is a

constant fight to survive in the

Junglelands, we have learned to

kill and use all the parts of

almost any animal, but we do not

kill uturunku. They are sacred

kings of the jungle, and we dare

not cross them.

Design Notes: The first ability

models one way a jaguar hunts in real life by grabbing the throat and

waiting for the prey to suffocate. Your cat deals a bit of damage but

perhaps more importantly, holds the prey still for you to Strike.

The second ability demonstrates the jaguars favorite hunting method: stalk

the prey from downwind and then pounce. On a strong hit, your jaguar

rends the foe with their claws on the initial attack.

The third ability is related to the real-world bite force a jaguar has. They

can pierce turtle shells and, perhaps due to the hunting of turtles, learned to

bite heads near the ear. Their teeth pierce skulls and deliver a fatal wound

directly to the brain. I'm not making that up! That sounded to me like

when you End the Fight, but since you can't get an add to a progress move,

I opted for the ability to reroll any dice. That means you could reroll the

action die, one or both challenge dice, or all three.

Quest: An uturunku was found dead with a spear wound to the heart. The

nearby settlement of San Balix is angry and worried that a curse will hang

over them if the culprit is not found and punished. What do you know that

makes you think there is something more sinister afoot, and what was

unusual about the site where the dead uturunku was found?

    PATHS

    Path assets in the Junglelands offer the three major roles a character might

    play: warrior, hunter, and shaman.

    ANKA NAN

    The eagle warriors are an elite

    group who are known for their

    bravery and tactical minds.

    They go through a deadly

    initiation where they are given

    nothing but a tuksina (dagger)

    and lampa (shovel) and then

    tasked with trapping and killing

    a rahara, the large mud-dwelling

    snake with razor-like teeth and

    jaws that can open as wide as a

    Junglelander is tall.

    The next phase of training is to

    sit in the jungle for days on end

    learning to watch and notice any

    movement. Whether it is the

    snake slithering by, the eagle

    flying over head, or the tiny ant

    marching to its home, an eagle

    warrior trains their eyes and

    brain     to  quickly     notice

    movement and assess any threat

    in the situation. This gives them   a  tactical  advantage  as  they  often   see

    things that others miss.

    Design Notes: The first two abilities demonstrate an eagle warrior's

    courage in the face of danger. They have almost always been in worse

    situations and are confident they will be victorious. The second ability, in

    particular, is about that confidence striking fear into the heart of an

    opponent and thereby granting the add +1 until a 1 is rolled on the action

    die. If this seems too powerful, you may only apply this bonus to firstborn

    and Junglelanders since animals, beasts, and horrors may not be afraid to

    see an eagle warrior in action.

    The third ability is about the eagle warrior being able to see what others

    cannot and assess the implications of this new knowledge.

    Quest: Wayanaysi, an eagle warrior of great renown, has retired from the

    life of a warrior and now trains those deemed worthy of becoming eagle

    warriors. What great exploit did Wayanaysi accomplish that relates to one

    of your vows, and why is his knowledge critical to your success?

20         THE JUNGLELANDS | BASED ON SOUTH AMERICAN MYTHOLOGY
PAQU HAMPIQ

The paqu hampiq are the shaman

of the Junglelands. They are

viewed as spiritual guides and

masters of mysticism. Much of

their power comes from their

ability to move between the

spiritual world and the physical

world thereby giving them

access to the knowledge only

held by the spirits.

It is said that a paqu hampiq

can't be killed unless the

ancestoral spirits give their

approval.     Stories abound of

paqu hampiqs who receive a

mortal wound only to stand back

up and give a prophetic message

to their attacker.

But it is not just the spirits of our

ancestor that a paqu hampiq can

commune with. Animal spirits, elemental spirits, and some say even the

Mother Snakes themselves will all communicate with, assist, and empower

a paqu hampiq of the purest heart.

Design Notes: The first ability allows you to commune with the spirits.

You might do this to find hidden information (almost like scrying) or to

learn truths lost to time.

The second ability lets you leverage any info you gain from the spirits.

The third ability gives you a big bonus on the brink of death, but it comes

at the price of allowing only a weak hit. I think of it as the ancestral spirits

giving you a second chance because they have a dire mission for you or a

dark secret to impart that you may wish you had not learned.

In some South American cultures, the two other rituals in this supplement

(the healing and shapechange ones) are abilities often ascribed to shaman,

so you may consider picking those up to complement this path.

Quest: The settlement of Tichito's shaman was beloved by all as the village

healer and wise counselor. In a violent attack by raiders, the shaman was

shot through the heart with an arrow. Despite the mortal wound, the

shaman recovered but is now a changed person who continually spouts a

prophecy of impending doom. What is this prophecy, and how does it

involve you?

IRONSMITH: FLAVOR PACKS                                                           21
    TUJLLAKI

    Hunting and tracking are among

    the most necessary skills in the

    Junglelands if we are to continue

    to eat and survive. The children

    of skilled hunters are taught and

    trained from a young age, and as

    such, they are often excused

    from the normal duties around

    the settlement.

    Each year, the top hunters from

    around the region compete in the

    Great Hunt where they are each

    assigned to track and kill a

    terrible beast that is plaguing

    one region or another. After

    making their assigned kill, they

    can then track and find another

    hunter to assist with that

    hunter's kill. At the end of two

    weeks, the hunters reconvene to

    see who made the most kills.

    Design Notes: This asset is your very basic hunting bonuses. I really don't

    think this would be specific to SouthAmerican or Mesoamerican culture as

    hunting was a critical part of almost any pre-industrial society. However,

    it came up enough that I included it here.

    The first ability gives you a bonus to tracking down your prey as well as

    remaining hidden from them. You don't want them to know you're coming

    for them! Compared to the Wildblood asset, you get a bump to momentum

    here but that's because of the narrowed focus.

    The second ability represents your trap-making skills. While you could

    arguably lump this in with the first ability, I decided to make it explicitly

    defined.

    The third ability is similar to the Cave Lion asset, but here you get an add

    +1 instead of switching the stat you use.

    Quest: A mysterious creature has been silently killing one person each

    night in a nearby settlement. The people believe it is a beast of some kind,

    but the tracks are unusual and unknown. Can you find this stealthy

    creature before they strike again? What is unusual about the way that it

    kills its victims?

22  THE JUNGLELANDS | BASED ON SOUTH AMERICAN MYTHOLOGY
UTURUNKU NAN

The jaguar warriors take their

cues from their namesake. They

are swift, strong, and stealthy.

These warriors are known for

their ferocity and ruthlessness in

battle and never run from a fight.

Some Junglelanders claim that

one cannot become a true jaguar

warrior until a strong spiritual

connection has been made with

a great jaguar spirit. Others say

it takes the blessing of a shaman

to achieve the power that jaguar

warriors have. Wherever these

abilities come from, the jaguar

warriors are well-respected and

not to be trifled with.

Design Notes: When I first

made this asset, it had a lot of the

same features as taking the

jaguar companion asset. After noticing       that,  I  decided  to  make  the  two

assets cover slightly different ground.

While stalking and hiding go together, what's swimming doing in the first

ability? Real-life jaguar's are not only stealthy hunter but accomplished

swimmers. They hunt caiman! Where stalking and hiding would use

+shadow as their stat, the swimming would likely be +iron.

Much like the eagle warriors, jaguar warriors had battle regalia and at times

would wear animal pelts to gain the power and abilities of the animal. The

second ability represents the ferocity of a jaguar warrior and is modeled

after the Berserker asset's second ability.

The third ability represents the idea that jaguar warriors wanted to take

captives during battle. Killing a foe was considered sloppy. Additional,

this ability "breaks the rules" by allowing you to burn momentum on a

progress roll, but it reduces each challenge die by 1. However, your

momentum must be greater than BOTH challenge dice. For example, let's

say you have +8 momentum and 6 progress in a fight when you decide to

End the Fight. Rolling the challenge dice gives you a 6 and a 7 allowing

you to burn momentum (go back to your reset value) and then reduce the

challenge dice to 5 and 6. Now the miss is a weak hit.

Quest: A jaguar warrior under the influence of a powerful hallucinogen is

going on a rampage. What did they see that drove them to this madness,

and why does it bode ill for you even if you can stop their killing?

IRONSMITH: FLAVOR PACKS                                                             23
    RITUALS

    Ritual magic in the Junglelands is generally is held in high regard, and

    shaman or other practitioners are seen as advisers, healers, and a blessing

    to any settlement.

    ALLINYACHIY

    The shaman mystics are known

    for their ability to heal others,

    but this healing is not limited to

    physical ailments.  A good

    shaman takes a more holistic

    view of healing and can cure the

    ills of body, mind, and soul

    through their allinyachiy ritual.

    This healing ritual is performed

    with  much        ceremony  and

    accouterments.      Usually the

    recipient is laid in a circle of

    aromatic vines while wafts of

    smoke from bowls of burning

    incense blow over them. Drums

    and sacred rattles accompany

    the rhythmic and melodic chants

    of the shaman.

    Design Notes: The first ability

    makes your physical healing

    more potent as you channel the

    power of the spiritual realm while  the  second  ability  grants  healing  to  a

    person's spirit.

    The third ability represents gaining insight and direction by ingesting the

    hallucinogenic ayahuasca plant and going on a spiritual vision quest. This

    gives you a neat way to roleplay with the spirits and find a way forward in

    a vow when you've been hitting a lot of misses.

    Additionally, note that allinyachiy is a full blown ceremony meaning it

    would take time and effort to perform. This is something that would be

    difficult to do out in the wilderness unless you had time to gather the

    necessary components and carried sacred objects with you.

    Quest: A shaman is reportedly able to sift through the memories of the

    ancestors to re-discover lost knowledge. What is it that you desperately

    need to know, and which of your ancestors hold the key to this knowledge?

24        THE JUNGLELANDS | BASED ON SOUTH AMERICAN MYTHOLOGY
PAMPA SUYU

Apowerful shaman can entangle

their own nuna (soul) with that

of the great jaguar spirit making

the two almost become one.

They  can         then  use  this

connection to force their body to

transform fully into a jaguar or

even a fierce half-human half-

jaguar creature.

To perform such a ritual takes

much  study       and   is   also

dangerous as it can warp the

body and mind. Weaker mystics

have been known to lose control

of the spiritual connection and

either have their body torn apart

or lose their mind to that of a

beast forever.

Design Notes: You power this

transformation with a spiritual

energy called nuna, but the transformation causes physical damage as your

body shifts into a normal jaguar animal. You can then make moves

leveraging some innate aspect of your jaguar body, but it's a choice.

For example, say you have +5 nuna and want to sneak into a settlement

with Face Danger +shadow. There are three options:

1. Make the move as normal. Do not suffer -nuna.

2. Frame it as the jaguar being stealthy. Add +1 but suffer -1 nuna.

3.    Frame it as using your spiritual energy to shift your jaguar spots

      into a more advantageous design. Roll +nuna but suffer -2 nuna.

The last two abilities allows a changes to your form (a werejaguar and an

ethereal version of either form) giving you new ways to leverage the

transformation in the fiction such as carrying large objects with bestial

strength, climbing places where arms would be necessary rather than

jumping or clawing, phasing through walls or trees as a spirit, making a

Strike laced with spiritual energy, etc.

Bonus: Check out Samuel Rondón's asset calledTherianthropy on Patreon

or the Ironsworn Discord as alternate version of a were-creature asset.

Quest: A mad mystic is said to be able to transform into a snake clearly

denoting their evil intentions. What is their dastardly plot, and how have

the animal spirits been adversely affected by it?

    NEW FOES

    The foes of the Junglelands shy away from horrors not because there are

    no ghost-like legends in SouthAmerican but because many of those stories

    fit the categories in Ironsworn better as animals or beasts than horrors.

    This is not to say you can't have horrors in the Junglelands. You absolutely

    can and should, but the core Ironsworn horrors will fit just as well.

    Additionally, there are three Mother Snakes included as firstborn who were

    considered deities by some SouthAmerican cultures. While they are close

    to that status in the Junglelands as well, I set them to be firstborn (rather

    than beast) to demonstrate their ancient lineage and sapience. They truly

    were the first inhabitants of the Junglelands by virtue of helping to create

    it. While these beings have a more positive bent to them in their

    descriptions here than in their real-world equivalents, it would still be

    possible to find your character at odds with them or needing to prove your

    worth to them. Therefore, they are included as foes in case you want to

    have them physically (not just mystically) in your game sessions.

    Furthermore, there are a few Mesoamerican foes listed. With such an

    overlap between some of the types of foes (particularly, the sheer volume

    of mythological snakes from SouthAmerica and Mesoamerica!), I thought

    they best fit the flavor of the SouthAmerica set. Specifically, theAhuizotl,

    Camazotz, and Quetzalcoatl are more Mesoamerican in origin but fit the

    idea of the Junglelands really well.

          ·  Howl at the moon

          ·  Pounce and rake

Tactics:  ·  Tail attack

As if being hunted by a pack of wolves was not enough, the Junglelands

also have packs of aquatic wolves. The ahuizotl wolves live near lakes or

rivers and spend close to half their waking hours in the water. Their feet

are slightly larger with webbed toes making them exceptional swimmers.

While the ahuizotl share most of the same characteristics with their regular

wolf cousins, these wolves have two distinctions.

First, their black and blue fur grows together in large spiky mats that then

strengthen into the same consistency as their claws, This effectively gives

them a layer of spiked armor making them more difficult to capture alive.

Secondly, they have a three-fingered appendage (two fingers and a thumb)

at the end of their tail that we refer to as a hand for lack of a better word.

They can use this hand to grasp and manipulate items such as a haunch of

meat or branches for building a den. They can also use this tail-hand as a

method of attack if they have their prey held on the ground.

Quest: The river village of Boraba has been trying to rebuild since the

river flooded over half the settlement. Many buildings were lost during the

flood and some are still submerged as the river seems to have permanently

claimed part of the land. A pack of ahuizotl have moved into one such

submerged house and now terrorize the populace by killing off the few

livestock of the village. Why are the people of Boraba unwilling to kill

these ahuizotl despite the damage they inflict?

Is there a burrowing version of the ahuizotl?      If so, what

unique characteristic do they have?

    The "Floating Cowhide" creature certainly looked laughable, but the first

    time one wrapped its flat body around a Junglelander who was trying to get

    water from the river, we knew it was no laughing matter. That person

    escaped with their life due to the quick thinking of a bystander, but not all

    are so lucky.

    A cuero usually hunts alone, gliding on the river currents attracting prey

    with its black and white splotched body. After wrapping up a victim in its

    body, it will begin to spin rapidly around the victim slicing them up with

    its many bony hooks on its underbelly. It can also attack by spinning itself

    so that its own body is wrapped up to the size of a spear and then fling itself

    at its prey using its front claws as the spear head.

    Despite their bold coloring with bright white spots, they can be difficult to

    see in the muddy river waters of the Junglelands. We tried plunging spears

    or sticks into the water before we entered a river in order to chase the cuero

    away, but we have found that doing so only announces our presence. If

    refilling a water skin or gathering jugs of water is necessary, get into and

    back out of the river as fast as possible for the cuero never stop their hunt.

    Quest:Amystic claims that they will gain control over the element of water

    through a long and complex ritual. However, they need to perform the

    ritual inside of a tent made of cuero hide. What other entity lurks in the

    deep river waters nearby that must also be dealt with?

    YOUR TRUTH

    Are all cuero black and white, or do they have different

    colorations? If they have variety, what purpose does this

    serve?

Rank:     Dangerous (2 progress per harm;      inflicts  2  harm)

          ·  Gila monster sized lizard

Features: ·  Poisonous bite and skin

          ·  Deadly scorpion tail

          ·  Hunt for food

Drives:   ·  Sun on the rocks

          ·  Usurp homes as its shelter

          ·  Paralyzing tail strike

Tactics:  ·  Poison bite

          ·  Leave a trail of poison

While it is true that nearly every creature from the jungles can kill you, the

reptiles of the jungles are especially deadly. The ix hunpedzkin is no

exception to this. It is a large lizard with impossibly tough skin that not

only delivers poison through its bite but also through its stinger at the end

of a long, scorpion-like tail.

As a top tier scavenger species, the ix hunpedzkin prefers to take advantage

of the work of other creatures when it can. It scares away lesser predators

to steal their kills and finds dens or lairs of other animal to take as its own.

Unfortunately, this also includes our own homes. Once an ix hunpedzkin

finds a settlement, it will usually pick out a building or structure to call its

home and drive out or kill those inside. Once entrenched, these stubborn

creatures are nearly impossible to flush out.

Our main advantage when hunting ix hunpedzkin is that its height only

comes up to a Junglelander's waist. While this makes them a huge lizard,

a group of our hunters is usually able to surround and kill one with

overwhelming numbers.

Quest: An ix hunpedzkin just took up residence in a home minutes ago. An

infant is still inside and is in immediate danger. Can the infant be saved?

YOUR TRUTH

What unique and unusual markings do ix hunpedzkin have?

    Features: ·  Long neck and glowing yellow eyes

              ·  Flat face with a circular maw

              ·  Take long naps standing up

              ·  Knock limbs out of trees

    Tactics:  ·  Track by smell

              ·  Bull rush and knock down

    Some may describe the jarjacha as cute or innocent looking when they first

    see one, but they learn the truth as soon as this colorful and furry creature

    opens its circular mouth of jagged teeth. It looks like a purple and blue

    furred giraffe that a child might have a doll of, but the jarjacha is a hunter

    who has developed a very specific taste for monkeys.

    The jarjacha's long neck allows it to reach the treetops with ease. It will

    smell for large quantities of monkey droppings and then go towards the

    trees in that area with its head and neck lowered toward the ground. This

    makes the monkeys think they are safe high up in the trees. Then the

    jarjacha swiftly thrusts its head up cracking and knocking down branches

    and possibly knocking monkeys out of the tree as well.

    The most disturbing thing about the jarjacha is the sound that it makes: a

    high-pitched, almost human voice saying "Jar, jar, jar, jar!" The word

    always comes in sets of four and is not the only sound that it can make.

    Some have been known to mimic human speech much like a parrot, but the

    tone of its voice can give you nightmares.

    Quest: The howler monkeys have been particularly vocal the past few days,

    and the overseer thinks this is a sign of a herd of jarjacha moving into the

    area. If there are jarjachas, the overseer needs them eliminated as there is

    only one safe path to this settlement that must remain open for supplies and

    trade. What makes you think the jarjacha is only the beginning of the

    problem?

    Do the jarjacha have horns?

           ·   Build dams to flood areas

Drives:    ·   Eat gigantic insects

           ·   Defend its territory

           ·   Impale with spikes

Tactics:   ·   Swim to safety

           ·   Stay hidden in the shallows

Kori are not extremely dangerous unless they are provoked. They are

naturally non-aggressive and usually go about their day in relative ease and

quiet, but this confidence on their part is due to the fact that they know they

can handle most threats with a whack of their saw-like tail.

The bigger threat from the kori is flooding or waterways being rerouted as

they dig pathways for the water and build their den. Much like beavers,

they prefer flooded lands as homes but have been known to change the

course of small rivers to accommodate their housing preferences rather

than building where the river currently runs. They will start digging a

trench at the site where they want their new home to be and dig that trench

all the way back to a water source. This sends water rushing to the new

area but gives it no outlet thereby making it a flooded and stagnant area.

Quest: The stream used by a local settlement as a water source has nearly

dried up. It is suspected that a family of kori moved in further upstream,

and the overseer needs someone to go get the stream back on course and

make sure it is not bothered again by the kori. What unusual thing was

revealed when the stream waters dropped so rapidly, and why is it an ill

omen for you?

YOUR TRUTH

The kori eat ants and other insects. What unusual aquatic

insects are their favorite? How are these insects dangerous to

the Junglelanders?

    Tactics:  ·  Ram boats to tip them

              ·  Knock unconscious and then bite

    The buck-toothed pira nu fish may not seem as deadly as the piranha that

    inhabit most waterways, but the pira nu are actually worse. Their thick

    skulls and large heads that look similar to a horse combine with their

    extreme speed in the water to make an excellent battering ram. They can

    break your leg bones if you are standing in the water and knock over

    canoes to dump you in the river.

    Their teeth are flat for grinding the blood out of flesh. Rather than tearing

    the flesh apart, they have the bite force to break bones through the skin.

    They especially target smaller appendages such as fingers and toes which

    they can crush with a single bite. As they grind the blood from their prey,

    the normal piranha are attracted making a problem doubly worse.

    Quest: A small waterhole has been overrun with pira nu. A priest wants to

    use the spot for divine ceremonies but needs to be able to safely get into the

    water. What was this area before the flood came that created this

    waterhole? What might the priest really be after?

          ·  Build protective nests like a bird

          ·  Poisonous bite

Tactics:  ·  Fly-by attack

          ·  Drop from above

Legend says that the colorful parrots of the jungles once put on such a

dance for Huayramama the Snake Mother of Wind that her next clutch of

serpent children were given the bright plumage of the parrots in their

honor. Whether that is true or not, the quetzalcoatl are normal-sized snakes

that still have the colorful green and red feathers along with wings they use

to fly. While the wings on their own couldn't hold the awkward writhing

snake aloft, the bright blue feathers on their tails act as a fan and rudder

giving them the appearance of swimming through the sky.

As with many animals that the Snake Mothers created in the Junglelands,

the quetzalcoatl are poisonous and quite deadly. They are known to hunt

hawks, and even eagles, entangling them in the sky before striking with

their lethal venom. As they both tumble toward the earth, the snake

quickly unravels from its prey which then plummets to the ground below.

If the fall doesn't kill the bird, the poison will within minutes. The

quetzalcoatl will usually fly their kills back up to their nests before

dismembering the bird to eat it one body part at a time.

Quest: Quetzalcoatl feathers are highly prized as a mark of stature in

headdresses and as powerful foci for rituals. Despite a single bite being

lethal to a Junglelander, one hunter has survived more than five bites over

the years. How do you suspect this hunter survived those encounters, and

why do you need their knowledge and skill?

    Tactics:  ·  Frighten with eerie whistle

    Grotesque is perhaps the best word to describe a romsiwamnari. They look

    like a cross between a rhea, a bat, and a pelican if the large pelican beak

    was a pair of lethal blades instead. Their flabby, gray skin is oily, and the

    calls that they make sound like a person drowning in sticky syrup.

    Aromsiwamnari never attacks to kill but to maim. They look for any thin-

    boned appendage on their prey such as a wing, arm, or leg which they can

    usually sever in a single strike. Once their prey is down with one of these

    lethal wounds, they proceed to take off the other appendages before eating

    the meaty torso. The concept of a mercy killing was not in our vocabulary

    until we met the romsiwamnari. Now we know it is a mercy to end the life

    of a fallen comrade before the evil bird finishes its work.

    Quest: A hunter lost their arm to a romsiwamnari but survived the

    encounter. Thanks to their determination and will to not only survive but

    thrive, they are still one of the top hunters in the area. This hunter now

Tactics:   ·  Lure into tunnels and trap

Wako are the larger cousins of the paca who love to dig in the soft earth

near waterways. Like their cousins, they are excellent swimmers and often

stay submerged for fifteen minutes or longer to avoid predators. The main

differences between the wako and the paca are the larger size, sharper teeth,

and clawed feet they use for digging.

While normally not aggressive, a wako will fight fiercely if they are

cornered. They also are known to be mischievous hunters as they will

create pitfall type traps by undermining a game trail or pathway so that

their prey fall and break a leg.

They have also been known to dig elaborate tunnel systems that are large

enough for some predators such as jaguars or wolves to fit inside. They

will then feign being injured to lure the predator in where either the tunnels

collapse or the predator gets hopelessly lost underground.

Quest: A family of wako had riddled an area with tunnels for years, and

one large section of ground finally gave way beneath a group of hunters.

While the hunters survived the encounter with few lasting injuries, they did

discover a much larger cave system that the wako exposed. What did they

see down there that has the whole settlement in a panic?

YOUR TRUTH

Like their paca cousins, wako young have horn-like scales

along their torso. Do these scales fall off after adolescence like

the pacas or do they enlarge and harden giving the wako even

more protection? If the spines remain, increase the rank of a

    While it may seem odd to say, a mile long serpent is not unheard of in the

    Junglelands. What is unusual about the god-sized snake Boiuna is that it

    doesn't live in the oceans but in the river Mayu Wanu. We don't know

    exactly how long Boiuna is, but there have been simultaneous reports of

    attacks by Boiuna's tail at one river settlement and by Boiuna's head at the

    next settlement.

    As far as we can tell, Boiuna draws in huge amounts of river water and then

    filters its meals almost like a whale with krill. As large as this beast is, you

    may think that the river has no other life in it because Boiuna eats it all, but

    this is not so. Legend says, and experience has confirmed, that Boiuna is

    an intelligent hunter and will transport whole schools of fish from one

    section of the river to the next in order to keep the population density at a

    steady norm.

    Some claim that Boiuna may be one of the lost Father Snakes, companion

    to the three Mother Snake god-like creatures, but according to our mystics

    there does not appear to be anything otherworldly about Boiuna. It has no

    mystical energy or abilities. It's just a snake big enough to swallow small

    settlements whole. That's all.

    Quest: Boiuna had not been seen in several years along the river Mayu

    Wanu until a few weeks ago. A shaman believes they have developed a

    concoction that can put Boiuna back into a hibernating state and thereby

    must be delivered straight into the maw of Boiuna.

Tactics:  ·  Attack during torrential rain to drown victims in floods

          ·  Constrict with their tail and peck at the eyes to blind

With the head of a rhea on the body of a fat snake, a falajitax sounds like a

laughable combination, but their sharp beaks, cunning minds, and

muscular tails make them a dangerous creature. Growing to a length as

long as any Junglelander is tall, falajitaxes attack with a ferocity likely

induced by the hallucinogenic eintykara honey they guard and feed on.

When on the hunt, a falajitax feigns being a wandering rhea while keeping

its tail hidden in the jungle undergrowth. If it can draw in a large predator

animal, it then attempts to quickly constrict the creature with its tail while

it pecks at the eyes. Once its prey is blinded in this way, it then moves on

to attack the leg joints so that the creature cannot escape. Even the mighty

jaguar can fall prey to a falajitax.

There are those who believe that the falajitaxes have some innate control

over the weather because they prefer to attack during the most torrential

downpours, but more likely they are simply opportunistic.

Quest: A nest of freshly hatched falajitax young has infested the nearby

hunting grounds. Can the creatures be dealt with before they eliminate all

    Kings, warriors, and paupers have all fallen to the tusk of a wild boar. The

    down when challenged. Now add to that idea a muscular body that is as

    large as a cow and rocky skin that acts like a suit of armor. This is the okpe.

    The creatures are omnivores and enjoy eating truffles or mushrooms as

    much as they enjoy eating freshly slain prey. The important thing to note

    about this is that the creatures seem to revel in eating any chance they get,

    but they love the tender meat of young prey the best. This drive for food

    is one of the few weaknesses that we can exploit when hunting an okpe.

    Perhaps because their rocky skin is so impenetrable, okpe have several

    inch-thick lines of unarmored flesh which allow them to move freely.

    Without these, the okpe could not move its own legs or rotate its head.

    That's how firm and inflexible their rocky armor is. However, the lines of

There are so many serpent-like creatures in the Junglelands, and they are

all deadly. The rahara is is a very long and thick serpent whose head is

made up almost entirely of its jaws. It has no eyes, just more teeth the

length of a Junglelander's forearm.

The raharas like to dig themselves into the mud and wait for prey to pass

close by. We're not sure how they breath while in this position, but they

have been known to stay submerged this way for hours at a time.

Moreover, we don't know how they detect creatures passing by. It may be

a sense of vibrations in the ground, or it could be sound that they follow.

We know that they have some sort of visual or heat sense because they can

latch onto campfires at night from a great distance and often surprise

sleeping Junglelanders. Because of this, it is advisable to sleep far away

from the fire pit or up in a hammock strung between trees.

Quest: A rahara attacked the pigsty of a farmer, decimating the livestock

    The tosetax is a frighteningly large snake that folds itself into a V that puts

    its tail in the same direction as its head. From this position, the tosetax can

    more quickly devour its prey because it has a great toothy maw on both its

    tail and its head.

    When first attempting to kill a tosetax, we thought we could sneak up

    behind it and attack the vulnerable part of the V-shaped body right at the

    folding point. Unfortunately, the beast has a third mouth there as well, and

    each mouth is capable of striking independently despite it only having eyes

    on its head. Whether lashing out with these three jaws of death or knocking

    down whole trees on top of its victims, it is a rare event that a group of

    hunters can take down a tosetax.

    Other than eating is fill, we can find no discernible pattern to a tosetax's

    behavior. At times, they live in watery environments near a river, but they

    are also found in the rocky hills leading to the mountains. Some tosetax

    seem to develop a taste for typical prey animals while others hunt

    exclusively other predators or even people. Whatever their motivations,

    tosetax are deadly and best avoided if possible.

    Quest: Years ago an enormous tosetax destroyed an area of the jungle

    creating a huge pile of trees and earth that is now home to a pack of

    smaller and never before seen creatures. What are these creatures, and

    what makes them dangerous?

    YOUR TRUTH

    When a tosetax experiences a grievous wound, what does it do?

    Does it grow a new mouth in that place, or does it sever its own

    body in two with each part regrowing into a whole tosetax?

          ·        Act like a floating log

The scant evidence of firstborn that we have found in the ancient places of

the Junglelands points to a group of firstborn who are humanoid alligators.

Surprisingly, most of these ancient records seem to be poetry, and romantic

poetry at that. We can only assume that the Caimana people placed great

cultural importance to the finding of a mate and falling in love.

Despite their penchant for love, the only encounters we have had with

Caimana have been deadly. If they are not the mad ravings of survivors of

deadly animal attacks, the Caimana must be extremely isolationist from the

rest of the Junglelands. The survivors of supposed Caimana attacks speak

of larger than life alligators and a frenzy of blood, but this is true with many

encounters near the waterways and doesn't necessarily mean that the

Caimana are real.

It is true that we have found rice patties growing in unusual places which

is said to be the staple food of the alligator folk, but we have yet to find or

interact with a living Caimana.

Quest: A powerful creature rules the waterways near a settlement, and the

overseer believes that an alliance with the Caimana would help them

eliminate this monster. There have been multiple sightings of the Caimana

people in this region, but nothing has been confirmed. Why are you willing

to go on this wild goose chase for a people who may not exist?

YOUR TRUTH

According to legend, what unusual ceremony do the Caimana

hold when a child hatches from their egg?

    The flapping of leathery wings overhead in the middle of the night is

    usually enough to put someone on edge. Now imagine hearing that sound,

    but slightly deeper, and realizing that whatever is flying over your head is

    much larger than a bat. This may be the last and only sound a Junglelander

    hears before a Camazotz warrior takes their life.

    The Camazotz are bat-like humanoids who generally value holding closely

    to their ancient traditions. They eschew metal weapons for wooden spears,

    bows, or macuahuitls. All metals are considered sacred to them and are

    only used in ceremonial trappings such as necklaces, headdresses, or arm

    bracers. All of their daily use items are either wooden or ceramic pottery.

    Perhaps the most frightening characteristic of the Camazotz is their

    echolocation screams. While they can use this ability quietly, during battle

    they scream like a banshee. The reason for this may be practical such as

    being able to hear the echoes more clearly allowing quicker reaction time,

    but it may also be to inspire fear.

    Quest: The settlement of Dula recently cleared a small patch of the local

    forest only to find out that the Camazotz considered the area sacred

    ground. Chinpokusi, the overseer of Dula, has made offers of recompense

    and is attempting to replant the area, but the Camazotz have not found any

    offer satisfactory. Can violence be avoided?

    YOUR TRUTH

    Do the Camazotz people have wings on the back of their

    shoulders separate from their arms, or are their wings attached

    directly to their arms? What implications does this have for

    the weapons that they wield?

One of the strangest people of the Junglelands, if people is even the right

word, are the Eintykara who are a group of large bees that can work in such

concert that they are able to form a humanoid shape and fight, work, and

communicate as a normal human would. Their voice is made up of various

buzzing sounds that work together at just the right frequency to produce

close to normal sounding speech.

Each hive of Eintykara refer to themselves as a single organism, and

actions that are taken by separate groups within the hive are carried out

without any visible or audible signal that we are aware of. It's as if they

have a direct line of communication with each other within their minds.

We call this the hivemind, one being made of many.

The honey produced by the Eintykara is sought out not only for its nutrition

and exquisite taste but also because it is mildly hallucinogenic. Some

shaman seek out this honey to mix with the ayahuasca plant when

embarking on vision quests to hear from the ancestors.

Quest: A Junglelander claims to have fallen in love with an Eintykara hive

and says that they are to bonded to one another. Ajealous former lover has

sworn to kill the Eintykara hive and set out to do so. What causes you to

approve of this strange union, and what ulterior motive do you believe the

jealous lover has to visit death upon the Eintykara?

    The Mother Snake of the Wind is a deity figure credited with creating the

    wind to bring forth rain on the Junglelands so that it might grow and

    prosper. However, this deity is clearly visible and physically present in the

    world. She wanders the realms so high in the sky she looks like a tiny, thin

    cloud with her white and blue skin undulating.

    While contact with Huayramama is exceedingly rare, there are stories of

    Junglelanders receiving a blessing from her that healed them of an

    incurable disease. These same stories say that the Mother Snake can

    communicate mind to mind with any creature in the Junglelands and can

    soothe one who is pain with just her voice.

    However, don't think that Huayramama is only benevolent. The most

    severe lightning storms are ascribed to her as a punishment for abusing

    birds of the air or other members of nature. During these storms, huge

    lightning strikes cause raging fires despite the blinding rain. It is said that

    the smoke from these fires act as a cleansing offering to the skies and

    appease the Mother Snake.

    Quest: A friend and ally has a fatal wound that will fester and kill them

Tactics:       ·  Curse weakened victims to turn into insects

               ·  Lie in wait on makeshift rafts

The Munuane are a strange blue-skinned troll people with a very large

turtle-like beak on their head, stony skin, and eyes located on their knees

instead of their head. They are said to have been cursed byYacumama, the

Mother Snake of the Water, for over-hunting the waterways of the

Junglelands.      Yacumama said they needed to see things from the

perspective of the fish and moved their eyes to their knees.

Despite the odd placement of their visual sensory organs, they are

exceptional shots with a bow and arrow. They have long, gangling arms

that allow them to put the bows in eye-sight below their waist, and there is

something about this lower eye-level that allows them to judge distances

much better.

In addition to their prowess with the bow, the Munuane also retain some of

the mystical power of Yacumama in that they are able to pass on a curse of

their own. When in a battle with a Junglelander or another firstborn, the

Munuane will first wound their opponent with several arrows in places that

won't kill immediately, and then once their opponent nears death from

blood loss, they curse their victim to become an insect and live out their

days as such.

Quest: A parent claims to have seen their child cursed by a Munuane to

become an insect. A powerful shaman believes the curse can be reversed

but only with the right ingredients and only if the child can be found in

    Tactics:  ·  Trap victims in its cage

              ·  Squeeze and crush with their size

    The Ookempan are large ogres who generally lead a simple life with strict

    traditions. When they come of age, they craft their first "life cage" which

    is then attached to the shells on their back. As they age, their shells grow

    around parts of the cage thereby anchoring it there for the rest of their life.

    Life cages serve the two major pursuits in Ookempan culture. The first is

    food. Any other non-Ookempan species, no matter if they are sentient or

    not, is viewed as potential food. There are elaborate cooking traditions in

    Ookempan society, and the young of other species are particularly sought

    after for their tender meat.

    The second major pursuit of these turtle-like people is that of knowledge

    and study. Any subject caught and placed in their life cage who is not eaten

    will be left there for study. They may see how long a subject can live

    without food or water, how they react to various plants or concoctions, and

    even perform elaborate autopsies. In this way, the Ookempans hope to

    master the power of life itself.

    Quest: For days, a Junglelander could be heard calling out hoarsely for

    help. A group followed the sound back to an Ookempan camp where

    several people were marked as a part of an upcoming feast. It seems the

    camp is now being decorated for a festival, so the meal must be soon. Can

    the people be saved without incurring the Ookempan's wrath?

Another deity in the flesh, Sachamama is the Mother Snake of the Earth.

Her great bulk may not rival Boiuna in size, but she is none-the-less large

enough to have a whole landscape and ecosystem growing on her back.

She is said to seek balance in the world and will coax rapid plant growth in

barren areas and plow down other areas thick with trees and underbrush.

Sachamama has a wide, bony plate on her underbelly near what might be

considered the base of her neck. She can push huge mounds of earth to the

side with this or raise up to drop it back down swiftly like a large hoe in a

field of crops.

This Mother Snake also has the ability to manipulate metal ores in the

ground or in weapons with great magnetic pulses. She can push weapons

to the side or pull armored folk up next to her great bulk. It may even be

these magnetic waves that induce the hazy illusions that she can project to

confound people.

Quest: A villager returned from a solitary hunting trip with an extremely

rare plant claiming that Sachamama herself gifted them with it. However,

tensions are now on the rise as many other people are claiming they should

get the herb for one reason or another. Some say that none should have

    The third Mother Snake is Yacumama who holds power over the waters of

    the Junglelands. She prowls the oceans with her great bulk seeking to ever

    prove her power over all others. Where the other Mother Snakes have a

    benevolent or at least neutral side to their personality, Yacumama lords

    over her creation with pride and hubris.

    She has many powers at her disposal to destroy vessels in the open waters,

    but perhaps her favorite is to summon thick fog. As long as Huayramama

    is elsewhere, Yacumama can use the water temperature to reduce the wind

    to almost nothing so that the vessels barely move at all in the fog. Then,

    after this elaborate set-up,Yacumama begins to swirl the water beneath the

    vessels into a great whirlpool bringing all the occupants to a watery grave.

    Because of her aggressive nature, it is common practice to put criminals in

    smaller boats in front of trade vessels. They are told that if they can make

    the trade run unscathed byYacumama, they can have their freedom back at

    the end of the journey. Most criminals jump at this chance, but few live to

    see their freedom.

Sometime long ago, other humans set foot in the Junglelands, but the

firstborn were much more active at that time along with even more

primordial beings. The humans had no chance to establish a true society

and only barely survived as prey for the dominant species. Generations of

this terrible existence led to the Maricoxi.

The Maricoxi are human in appearance, but they lack societal advances

such as detailed language or complex tools. They regressed back to a

previous form of life as they fought for survival. Their days were filled

with killing, eating, and hiding. They still have no agricultural skills and

depend completely on hunting and gathering.

While we have tried to welcome them into our settlements and help

integrate them into our culture, we have yet to establish meaningful

relations with the Maricoxi.   They are rightly suspicious of nearly

everyone, and attack first without waiting to see how dangerous the

situation might actually be. The best thing we have found is to respect

them and leave them be.

Quest: A group of Maricoxi arrived at a settlement wounded and near

death. The people of the settlement took them in and are attempting to heal

their wounds, but they are worried about what the Maricoxi are fleeing

KOMIKAN: THE JAGUAR AND THE LLAMAS

In the ancient halls of the firstborn ruins we found reference to a game that

some of the firstborn played in the Junglelands. While it's original name

may have been Komikan, we call it "The Jaguar and the Llamas".

It is a two-player game where one player controls a single token on the

board representing the jaguar, and the other player controls twelve tokens

representing the llamas. Some regions use fourteen llamas instead of

twelve, or use eagles instead of llamas, so check with the specific region

you are in lest you commit a social error.

The players take turns moving one token at a time into an adjacent empty

space on the game board. This means the first player moves their jaguar

every turn, but the second player may only move a single llama each turn

(which llama is up to them).

If the jaguar can jump over a llama and land in an empty space, it eats that

llama token thereby removing it from the game board. If the jaguar eats

five total llamas, the jaguar player wins.

If the llamas can surround the jaguar in such a way that it has nowhere to

move (all adjacent spaces have llamas and there are no empty spaces to

allow the jaguar to jump and eat a llama), then the llama player wins.

This game can be taken very seriously and may even be used as a substitute

for combat in some cases. It's considered a warrior's game of strategy, and

young children are encouraged to play often to improve their strategic

thinking. Some parents will start their child as a jaguar in a tough situation

to challenge them to still eat the requisite five llamas. Other times, the

child will be given only six llama tokens and challenged to still defeat the

jaguar. The children who find winning strategies in these more difficult

circumstances are often given leadership or advisory roles when they

became full warriors.

Design Notes: Years ago, I learned a game similar to Komikan on a smaller

board, but it was called "The Hounds and the Hare" where three hounds

tried to corner the hare whose goal was to escape to the opposite side of the

board. The hounds had the restriction of only being able to move forward,

but the hare could move in any direction. No matter the side I picked when

playing against anAI online, I could almost never win. But I still had fun!

When I saw Komikan (or Taptana) as a game that an Inca emperor played,

I knew I had to include it in this flavor pack. Agame that you almost never

win? Sounds like my challenge dice! It was originally a jaguar and dogs

or goats, but I switched it to the llamas of theAndes mountains.

On the following pages, you'll find the game board, the tokens to use, and

a picture of the initial set-up of the board.

ALTERNATE VERSIONS

There are several alternate versions of this game that are used in real life

that you could have in your version of the Junglelands which include:

1. Change the animal types to regional animals.

2. Play only with the square portion of the board.

3. Use fourteen or even twenty llamas instead of twelve.

4.  Both players use their first turn to place a single token, and then

    each subsequent turn the jaguar player moves while the llama

    player must choose to either place one of their remaining llama

    tokens onto the board or move one that is already on the board.

Or use a combination of the above such as twenty llamas while using only

the square portion of the board. There are several YouTube videos

demonstrating how to play the many variations. I have given you extra

llamas in case you want to play with the fourteen or twenty version.
