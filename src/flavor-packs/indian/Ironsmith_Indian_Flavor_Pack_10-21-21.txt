IV  THE TIGERLANDS | BASED ON INDIAN/HINDU MYTHOLOGY
THE TIGERLANDS

Inspired by Indian/Hindu Mythologies

IRONSMITH: FLAVOR PACKS               1
   THE TIGERLANDS

   Each Flavor Pack for the Ironsworn RPG is inspired by some culture's

   mythology. The ideas presented are not exact duplicates of myths,

   cultures, or creatures from those cultures, but rather are general ideas

   meant to evoke a slightly different feeling rather than the viking-like

   setting of the Ironsworn core setting.

   The Tigerlands Flavor Pack was inspired by mythologies from India with

   an emphasis on Hindu mythologies.

   We had no choice but to leave the Old World. It was dying and so

   were we. However, we didn't realize we'd be trading certain death

   for only near certain death.

   Our fleets traveled due north and hit the southern edge of the

   Tigerlands where we quickly found ourselves near the bottom of

   the food chain of aggressive predators and fantastic beasts. By the

   time we fumbled our way west over the smaller mountain chain

   near the western edge of the continent our population was less

   than ten percent of what we had started out with. The coastal

   plains we found on the western edge of the continent beyond the

   mountains of Vibhaajan Rekha were our last hope.

   While our severely diminished numbers could scratch out an

   existence here, we must work the fields and hunt with only one eye

   on the work at hand for the other must be watching for the ever-

   present dangers of the Tigerlands. While the mountain range to

   our east provides a buffer, albeit a small one, we still send

   exploratory parties back east often not because we seek to expand

   our territory but because we need more resources to even have the

   hope of improving our living conditions here.

   While we have struggled to have any safe settlements in other

   regions of the Tigerlands, we have done enough cursory

   explorations to know the general lay of the land. The majority of

   the continent appears to be a stifling hot jungle environment. Even

   the mountain range to our east is hot and humid despite the

   heights. We are still learning the laws of this jungle, but we are

   wiser than when we first arrived.

   However, when we travel north on the continent, it quickly turns to

   the other extreme: arctic cold. The unfathomable heights of a

   second mountain range are likely the reason for this cold. What

   lays beyond is only whispered in legends of those people who came

   before us: the firstborn and the ancients. They too note in their

   writings that these lands are as dangerous as their namesake.

2  THE TIGERLANDS | BASED ON INDIAN/HINDU MYTHOLOGY

   BANJAR DVEEP                                                     BARREN ISLANDS

   Replaces: Barrier Islands (Region         1)         

   Features:

    Tumultuous waves that crash                   Hardy fisher-folk

   against island shores                           Daring pirates

    Powerful currents pushing                     Great plumes of soot and ash as

   between the islands                              the islands grow ever larger

   Known as the Barren Islands, Banjar Dveep is the group of barrier islands

   off the western coast of the Tigerlands. These islands grew quickly from

   underwater volcanoes leading many of the large islands to be nothing but

   rock, lava, and smoke. However, some islands nearer to the coast do have

   plant life likely from seeds in bird droppings and limited animal life. The

   few animals who call these islands home are often hearty and capable of

   killing, consuming, and digesting nearly anything.

   To survive in the Tigerlands, we have had to learn to fish the deep ocean

   waters, and the Barren Islands can provide some protection while we do so.

   They keep our fishing boats out of sight of the pirates roaming and break

   up some of the rougher ocean currents as they head towards to the low-

   lying coast. However, the monsoon season is unforgiving. We lose good

   fisher folk every year as they gamble that they can get one more catch in

   before the storms start. Foolish.

   Quest: An ambitious plan has been crafted by a group of settlements to set

   up a series of watch towers on various islands to act as a warning system

   for the pirates in the area. The problem is that the islands needed for these

   towers are completely barren, so wood and supplies will have be brought

   in. Which pirate who is active in the area do you know from your past?

   What evidence is there that this pirate is one step ahead of the settlements?

JEEVAN MAIDAAN                               PLAINS OF LIFE

Replaces: Ragged Coast (Region 2)             

Features:

 Shores sloping directly to sea            Areas of sparse forests hiding

 Beaches strewn with detritus               the region's predators

from terrible monsoons                      Fragile ecosystem all fighting

 Flat, green plains                         for the same resources

The western coastal plains were our salvation upon first arriving in the

Tigerlands. The powerful monsoons drive water far inland and bring with

it a plethora of organic matter that enriches the soil making it fertile ground

for crops. Unfortunately, those same monsoons also destroy much of what

we build year after year.

The settlements within range of the yearly monsoon flooding are

comprised of only temporary structures: tents or basic huts. Our more

permanent settlements are built closer to the mountain range to the east.

During the growing season, half our population moves west to grow crops

while the other half stays to protect the settlement proper. There is constant

travel between the two groups as we try to keep each safe from the threats

of the region which may be tigers hunting sambar or raiders hunting us.

There are a few saltwater lakes near the coast that have no outlet back to

the sea. Fishing these lakes has proved helpful for providing food with less

danger than the open sea, but sometimes a larger aquatic beast gets trapped

in the lake making it dangerous to fish.

Quest: The farming community of Ambepathur is preparing to head back

east to the settlement with their supply of crops from the season. However,

something more sinister has made its way into their food stores that will

endanger Ambepathur once it gets there. What is this foul thing, and what

harm did it cause you in the past to make you swear a vow to stop it?

IRONSMITH: FLAVOR PACKS                                                          5
   VIBHAAJAN REKHA                     THE DIVIDING LINE

   Replaces: Deep Wilds (Region 3)      

   Features:

    Southern rain forests            Roars of tigers making a kill

    Northern deciduous forests       Many swift mountain streams

    Bald mountain tops above the     Confusing mountain passes

   tree line                          Hoot of violent monkey troops

   The Vibhaajan Rekha mountain range act as a barrier protecting the rest of

   the Tigerlands from the fierce monsoons from the west. Due to this, the

   western slopes are often slick with rain while the eastern slopes are arid.

   Each side of the mountain range has it's own distinct ecosystem that has

   adapted to the different conditions, but both are dangerous.

   Traversing the western edge of the mountains is particularly treacherous

   because of a species of bright green moss that covers any exposed rock.

   The moss is not only slick making climbing difficult, but it also emits low

   levels of a poisonous gas. If you are around the moss for short periods of

   time, you may only hallucinate. Spend too long near the moss, and the

   lungs stop working as the chest muscles began to experience paralysis.

   Tigers and the smaller jungle cats hunt these mountains leaping from perch

   to perch or hiding among the foliage. The bright orange stripes of the tiger

   blend in with the thin orange leaves of the most common tree found in the

   southern rain forests.

   Quest: An expeditionary group set out to find a safe passage across the

   mountains to open up access to the eastern lands but has not returned on

   schedule. Who do you know that was a part of that team, and what

   happened between you in the past that you owe them a debt?

NADIYON KEE MAUT                                      DEATH OF RIVERS

Replaces: Flooded Lands (Region 4)       

Features:

 Forking rivers creating deltas      Strands of hanging gray moss

 Large carnivorous plants             obscuring sight lines

 Ghost forests of dead trees that    Thick patches of mud

drowned and starved                   Stench of rot

The Nadiyon Kee Maut is a large area of wetlands where the mountain

streams from the eastern edge of the Vibhaajan Rekha mountains join with

those from the far northern Sabhee Ka Kendr mountains. As the rivers

have headed toward the sea over the years, they have eroded their banks

causing much of the area to be covered with slow moving water.

As with most swamps, there are the dangers of being trapped in thick mud

and drowning in the fetid waters. However, there are two more distinct

dangers in this region. The first is the large carnivorous plants that dot the

area. Likely due to the lack of nutrients in the soil, these plants have

developed basic physical movements in order to trap anything from large

insects to mid-sized mammals that wander nearby. Some claim that vines

have reached out to grab them and pull them into the leafy jaws.

The second distinct danger are the ghost forests. These areas must have

once been vibrant woods but died out suddenly for an unknown reason and

still have the dead trunks of trees standing. The name for these areas

doesn't just come from the dead trees. Horrors are known to lurk in ghost

forests seeking to add more and more of the living to their number.

Quest: An ethereal green light floats deep within a ghost forest near an

area thought to be one of the spots of our people's original landing in the

Tigerlands. What artifact from the first generation is said to have been lost

in this area, and how does the green light connect to this legend?

IRONSMITH: FLAVOR PACKS                                                         7
   DAANTON KA JANGAL                             JUNGLE OF TEETH

   Replaces: Havens (Region 5)              

   Features:

    Predators stalking prey             Rumble of passing elephant

    Crumbling ruins of an ancient        herds

   and unknown people                    Eyes watching from the dark

    Criss-crossing game trails          Cacophony of creatures

   Daanton Ka Jangal is so named because of the sheer volume of deadly

   creatures who call this jungle their home. This region is home to both

   tigers and lions who constantly battle with one another over territory and

   kills. Leopards, jungle cats, alligators, poisonous snakes and other equally

   vicious predators all pale in comparison to the ferocity of the two cats

   battling to be king of the jungle.

   On top of the threat presented by the animals and beasts of the region, it is

   rumored that the firstborn make their homes within these jungles. While

   we have not yet confirmed the existence of the firstborn, most parties that

   set out to explore this region don't make it back and some of the recovered

   bodies have been pierced by spears. It's either a haven for raiders who

   know the ways of the jungle, or the firstborn do not tolerate interlopers.

   Quest: Rumors abound of a hidden valley deep within the jungle that is

   home to many unusual creatures that make coveted hunting trophies such

   as large, carnivorous reptiles who walk on their hind legs. However, the

   larger prize is a hidden temple of mystic power. What is this place rumored

   to have mystical influence over, and why do you need its power?

HAREE BAADHA                                          THE GREEN WALL

Replaces: Hinterlands (Region 6)                       

Features:

 Tightly packed trees with          Crumbling bridges built in the

trunks wider than an arm span         tall tree tops

 Rustling in the leaves above       Woody vines wrapped around

 Tiny and isolated settlements       trunks and dangling from above

The Green Wall is so named because it is a nearly impenetrable terrain of

interlocked trees. The deciduous trees here grow so close together that

some will join together at the trunks into great pods of trees and others

entwine branches with their nearest neighbors. Traversing through this

maze of trees means never being able to keep your bearings and constantly

exposing yourself to danger as you weave through tight spaces without the

room to properly defend yourself.

Some civilization or people group who lived here in the past built whole

settlements and pathways up within the canopy of the trees. Most of these

structures have long since decayed and rotted, but some few still remain

and may be used by those willing to risk their total collapse.

Quest: A specific species of tree in this region is said to have leaves with

powerful healing properties. These trees rarely win the battle against

taller or older trees in their search for nourishing sunlight, and those that

do survive are usually found stripped bare. We don't know whether some

animal eats the leaves or whether another people find these trees before we

get the chance to harvest the leaves. Who do you know that needs this

healing leaf, and what clue do you have as to who is harvesting the leaves

before the Tigerlanders?

    JEEVIT CHHAAYA                         THE LIVING SHADOWS

    Replaces: Tempest Hills (Region 7)      

    Features:

     Forests of conifer trees            Howls from packs of hunting

     Chilling wind blowing south          dholes (mountain wolves)

    from the mountains                    Dens of hibernating beasts

     Days with hours of darkness         Ghostly, fog-laden hollows

    The further north you travel, the closer to winter's grip you get. The region

    of Living Shadows is the entry way to the severe cold of the furthest north

    regions and is named for the way the land falls under the shadow of the

    unfathomably tall mountains of Sabhee Ka Kendr. The shadows move

    across the region creating an artificial night for hours at a time throughout

    the day.

    Animals such as bears, dholes, and the nocturnal civets hunt in ways that

    don't disrupt each others' food chain which has led to large areas of

    overlapping territories for these creatures. This makes travel through the

    region doubly dangerous as the dholes have been known to herd prey

    toward a great bear or vice versa.

    Quest: Small markers of stone with a single rune inscribed on them have

    been found throughout this region. Where have you seen this rune before?

    What makes you think that this bodes ill for those few Tigerlanders who

    call this region their home?

SABHEE KA KENDR                                              CENTER OF ALL

Replaces: Veiled Mountains (Region  8)       

Features:

 Mountains of unimaginable               Howling winds that freeze you

heights that block the sun                 to the core

 Steep-sided, jagged peaks               Hidden valleys with the

 Slow moving glaciers                     greenery of life

The Center of All is the name given to the northern mountain range of the

Tigerlands. The altitudes get so high that the climate is like that of an arctic

tundra despite it relative nearness to the hot jungles to the south.

The name of the region comes from one mountain in particular, the Peak of

Meru, which is considered to the be the literal center of the world where

even the stars above rotate about the great mountain. It is said to have its

four sides made of distinct materials: crystal, gold, ruby, and lapis lazuli.

If one could ever reach this mountain, it is said that you would find each

type of material imbued with a different mystic power.

Like a pale echo of Meru, there are deep valleys hidden within the Sabhee

Ka Kendr range that were gouged out by the glaciers still digging their way

through the mountains. Some of these valleys are said to house whole

civilizations that prefer to remain apart from the rest of the world.

Quest: An iron priest seeks someone to act as guide and protector for a

journey to Mt. Meru where the priest will beseech the gods. However, the

priest won't speak of their request lest it be cursed to fail. What do you

suspect the request to be, and why do you support the priest in this quest?

    PATALA DVAAR                               GATE OF THE UNDERWORLD

    Replaces: Shattered Wastes (Region  9)               

    Features:

     Thunder and lightning storms            Figures of shadow and light

    occurring without clouds                   clashing on the horizon

     Beautiful groves of trees               Multi-colored soils

     Lakes filled with jewels                Sweet smell in the air

    The area north of the Center ofAll is the gateway to the underworld known

    as Patala. Many of the features of Patala leak out into this gateway region

    such as the multi-colored soils and enticing fragrances meant to lower a

    person's guard against the demons who live here in relative wealth

    surrounded by beautiful trees, gardens, and lakes.

    Despite it's almost heaven-like aspects, this place is said to actually be the

    battleground between the asura and devas who will decide the ultimate fate

    of the Tigerlands. The constant lightning flashes that come without the

    accompanying rain cloud are the evidence of this near eternal war.

    No Tigerlander has ever set foot on these grounds for we know that we

    would be tempted to enter the underworld or kept in thrall by the demons

    of the region. Don't let the appearances fool you. This region means

    certain death.

    Quest: A strange being has shown up at a settlement claiming to be a deva

    refugee from the wars in Patala Dvaar. What makes you think their claim

    may be true? What portent of doom do they bring with them?

NEW ASSETS

Just as the terrain and regions are different in the Tigerlands, so too are the

people and their skills.

COMBAT TALENTS

As always, many of the core Ironsworn combat talents would fit well

within the Tigerlands setting. If you'd like to use traditional terms for the

various weapons, consider using the following:

  Axe - The Tabar can be a standard battle-axe or a longer polearm.

  Bow - The Dhanush is a standard longbow.

  Dagger - The Khukuri is curved and thicker than a traditional

   dagger.

  Fighting Claws - The Bagh Nakh are metal claws worn almost like

   gloves. While core Ironsworn does not have this weapon, you can

   use the Leaping Tiger asset (based on the Japanese tekko-kagi)

   available in the Firelands Flavor Pack.

  Mace - The Gada has a symmetrical head so it may be used from

   any angle.

  Sword - The Talwar is a thinner and curved blade, or the Khanda is

   more traditional, straight blade.

IRONSMITH: FLAVOR PACKS                                                          13
    CHAKRAM

    A chakram is a circular blade

    that is hurled towards a foe in an

    attempt to embed it in their body.

    Some wielders of chakram are

    so accurate with their throws

    that they can sever an arm or leg

    from a foe with a single throw.

    It has become popular in the

    Tigerlands to wear chakram of

    various sizes on a turban. In this

    way, one is never without their

    weapon, and there is little risk of

    cutting oneself while carrying

    the weapon.

    While not meant to be a melee

    weapon because of the inherent

    danger to the wielder, some

    warriors train with specialized

    gloves of thick leather with thin

    metal strips that protect the

    palm. Despite this level of protection, there is still  a   strong possibly      of

    causing self-inflicted wounds that can be debilitating  in  a battle.

    Design Notes: The first ability is meant to represent the approach you

    choose in battle. Are you throwing multiple chakram for cover fire, lining

    up a devastating shot, or building a combo of throw a chakram and then

    move in for melee? Could be fun to chain into the third ability.

    Most warriors will carry a few chakram (usually on their turban), maybe

    three to six. While this provides additional "ammo" as it were, you'll never

    get as many shots as with a quiver of arrows. This means that at some point

    you'll have to recover your chakram to continue using them.

    The third ability is the dangerous melee usage of the chakram. While the

    blades rely more on blunt force rather than razor sharpness to allow for

    throwing them bare-handed, using them in melee directs much of the force

    back onto the user. If you upgrade for this ability, it is likely only with the

    narrative use of the metal-lined gloves mentioned above. This more

    aggressive style of attack also builds your momentum fueled by adrenaline.

    Quest: Legend tells of a chakram that was blessed by Indra to gain the

    mystical energies of lightning. In what dangerous site is this weapon

    rumored to be located, and what protects it there such that no one has been

    able to claim it before?

KATAR

The katar, also known as a

punch dagger, was designed to

take advantage of the force of a

punch to pierce armored foes.

While the blades are not long,

they can be fully embedded up

to the hilt leaving a very deep

wound on the opponent that can

cause them to bleed out.

To excel in the use of katar, one

must undergo rigorous agility

training more than strength.

This allows the wielder to dodge

and parry thereby getting inside

the foe's guard to deliver

devastating  blows.       Katar

wielders may also train as battle

dancers to build their agility.

Design Notes: The first ability

gives you extra damage at the

cost of losing momentum to represent the difficulty of puncturing armor.

If you are punching hard enough to embed the blade deeply, it's going to

cost you some of your forward inertia/momentum to pull the blade back

out in preparation for further attacks.

The second ability is meant to represent the juke and jive movements

necessary to get close to a foe. In my mind, I imagine it like a boxer

circling and guarding before a swift strike. I also highly suggest using an

altered version of Secure an Advantage where a strong hit gives you both

good things and a weak hit gives you only one.

The third ability is for when you desperately need that extra damage to End

the Fight. You're recklessly driving the blade (or blades if you dual wield)

down into your foe but that may open up your flank to attacks.

Quest: The settlement of Rajput has an annual tradition of sending out

their bravest warriors to hunt a tiger with only a katar. However, this year

an ominous sign was seen before the ceremonially start of the hunt. What

was this ill omen? What danger do you know lurks nearby that may take

advantage of the fact that many warriors will be gone from the settlement?

    PATAR

    The patar is essentially a long

    sword attached to a gauntlet so

    that the wielder has the blade

    extending out from their closed

    fist. By having the blade as an

    extension of the arm rather than

    perpendicular to it, pressure is

    taken off the wrist which allows

    for stronger strikes.

    Tigerlanders have become adept

    at using the gauntlet portion of

    the patar almost as a buckler.

    With one movement, a warrior

    can block or parry an attack with

    the gauntlet and then continue

    their momentum to follow-up

    with an attack of their own.

    Design Notes: While the patar

    in real life isn't quite as good

    defensively, I imagined in the

    Tigerlands that they extended the gauntlet portion further down their arm

    and developed techniques to make blocking with these longer gauntlets a

    more viable strategy. I also wanted some combat abilities to encourage

    something other than just Strike or Clash.

    The second ability is meant to also emphasize the movement from defense

    to offense while wielding a patar.

    The third ability is a standard risk/reward move. In my mind, the loss of

    momentum is representative of losing good positioning in melee as you

    over commit to your swing for more damage. While this seems like an

    easy trade (-1 momentum for +1 harm), draining your momentum takes

    away your ability to burn momentum when you need it most. That's

    dangerous indeed.

    Quest: You have recovered the broken patar of the famous overseer Ranjan

    Bhagat who was killed in battle, but the weapon is resistant to all attempts

    to reforge it with standard iron. Which ironsmith can work with this rare

    black iron to reforge the blade? What does the blade symbolize to the

    people of the region?

16         THE TIGERLANDS | BASED ON INDIAN/HINDU MYTHOLOGY
URUMI

The urumi is a whip-like weapon

with several flexible blades

making up the whip.             This

weapon is nearly as dangerous to

the wielder as it is to foes, and as

such, is often the last weapon to

be mastered by the greatest

warriors.

When used correctly, the urumi

is a whirlwind of blades that

creates a nearly impenetrable

shield     around  the  wielder.

Anyone who dares approach

may die from a literal thousand

cuts.

The urumi is also an easily

hidden weapon as it can be worn

as a belt with pants that have a

single belt loop around the waist

reinforced to act as a sheath.

Design Notes: The first ability represents the idea of pushing back your

enemies in this onslaught of blades. Mechanically, you are choosing how

to use this feature of the urumi. You might use it deal damage (normally

no possible on a Face Danger), or it could build into the next moves with

either more momentum or an add.

The second ability showcases your increased ability to threaten multiple

targets at once by making the first ability more reliable.

The third ability allows you to swing the urumi in such a way that the

blades separate further from each other. (Yeah, I'm breaking physics.

Sorry!) This gives you a better chance to hit, but you'll hit with less of the

blades. Hence, the lower harm.

Quest: A great urumi master has retired as a warrior to become a teacher

of the whip sword. Pupils are being sent on training missions with the

stated intent of learning to master the urumi. What have all these training

missions centered around that makes you think there is an ulterior motive

at play? What tragic event happened on the last training mission?

    COMPANIONS

    I know you could use the Cave Cat asset as a tiger and the Mammoth asset

    as an elephant, but I thought the Tigerlands could use their own specific

    version of these creature companions.

    BAAGH

    The majestic tiger, namesake of

    these lands, is a sacred creature.

    Their skills as a hunter are

    unmatched   in       the     animal

    kingdom due in part to their

    beautiful   stripes  acting    as

    camouflage in the jungles and

    plains.

    Very rarely, a Tigerlander is able

    to befriend a baagh and take it as

    his or her companion. The cats

    are apex hunters and warriors

    whose loyalty is unfaltering.

    Design Notes:The first ability is

    for entering fights while the

    second is during the fight.

    However, it may be difficult to

    use the second ability to Strike

    immediately after using the first

    ability because narratively you

    have come out of hiding to Enter

    the Fray. Therefore, you may need to          Face    Danger   or   Secure an

    Advantage to get your tiger back into hiding  before  you can  use  the second

    ability to Strike your foe.

    The third ability is one of the real life ways a tiger ends a fight. They just

    pounce on the back of a creature and snap its neck. r/NatureIsMetal! Since

    it may not make narrative sense for your tiger to snap the neck of an

    ethereal horror, I went with the more general wording of a "death blow."

    Quest: You are approached by a group of rakshasa who offer to help you

    bond with a baagh cub in return for completing a quest for them. What is

    it they ask of you that they cannot do themselves? Why is particularly

    dangerous?

18              THE TIGERLANDS | BASED ON INDIAN/HINDU MYTHOLOGY
HAATHEE

War elephants are used in the

Tigerlands mainly to inspire fear

in enemies and disrupt cavalry

or infantry attacks.        These

elephants are often fitted with

iron blades on their tusks,

armored skirts on their sides,

and      tower-like         wooden

structures known as howdahs on

their backs.       Any foe with

intelligence knows the futility of

a frontal assault against one of

these beasts.

Moreover, elephants are often

given    alcohol      or    other

intoxicants    to     make  their

rampaging that much more

violent. Even the elephant riders

at times have trouble controlling

or stopping a charging elephant.

While it is rare to have a full elephant unit on a battlefield, even a handful

of well-trained pachyderms can turn the tide of battle.

Design Notes: The first ability models the immediate aura of fear an

armored elephant projects onto the battlefield.

The second ability gives a significant way to use the elephant in a battle

that is not just damage dealing. They can get close to a fortified location

and tank damage while ripping down the ramparts. Your character may

have some grappling hooks and rope attached to the howdah to help

facilitate this use.

It's not really a party until the elephant is drunk! Yes, elephants were

intoxicated at times during their use as war mounts. This not only caused

way more havoc on the battlefield but also allowed the elephant to shrug

off damage more easily. If you get a weak hit or miss, it says to Pay the

Price. Since you'd already be doing that on a miss, I put the "make it

worse" clause. I mean, your elephant is drunk and raging. It's causing all

sorts of damage, and you may lose control of it. After all, I'm sure it takes

a while for the elephant to sober up. And the hangover? I shudder to think.

Quest:Aband of raiders has a group of ten or more elephants that they use

to attack settlements. What artifact might the leader of the raiders be

willing to negotiate stopping their attacks to obtain? What will make

getting this artifact dangerous and time consuming?

    PATHS

    Path assets in the Tigerlands offer two roles that focus on battle and one

    that focuses on relationships.

    GATKA

    Those who learn the technique

    of gatka are known as battle

    dancers. They specialize in in

    quick,   fluid  movements       to

    deliver many blows in quick

    succession. In most regions of

    theTigerlands, the battle dancers

    wield a curved blade called a

    talwar in one hand and a buckler

    in the other.

    By focusing their body into

    quick bursts of movement, those

    who practice gatka can dodge

    incoming attacks so precisely as

    to put them in the perfect

    position for a counter attack.

    In some Tigerland regions,

    competitions of battle dancing

    are held where the winner is a

    gifted a magnificently crafted

    talwar.

    Design Notes: The first ability is similar to the core staff asset in that you

    can make a melee attack with +edge at the cost of inflicting less harm.

    If you don't have the initiative and a foe is charging you, the second ability

    would be fitting if you want to gain the initiative back. However, it would

    also be good if you already had the initiative because you could build

    momentum by goading your opponent to attack you and miss.

    The third ability is for when you either have the time to perform a ritual

    combat display or must move quickly in the heat of battle to gain

    advantageous positioning.

    Quest: Prem Lata, a gatka master, has taken to challenging overseers to

    duels for leadership of the settlement. If the overseer refuses the challenge,

    Prem releases a group of warriors to pillage and plunder the settlement.

    Attempts have been made to liberate settlements taken over by the gatka

    master, but the citizens of those settlements exhibit a new-found and deep

    loyalty to Prem by fighting off the liberators. What hold does Prem have

    over his new subjects? What is the gatka master's ultimate goal?

20                 THE TIGERLANDS | BASED ON INDIAN/HINDU MYTHOLOGY
SAARATHEE

On the plains of the western

coast of Jeevan Maidaan, a

chariot can be a powerful

weapon, and the Tigerlanders

there have perfected the art of

being a charioteer.

They begin by training the

horses.    The continent's most

renowned equestrian masters

work with the horses to enable

them to make tight turns and

traverse difficult terrain while

keeping the rider safe in the

chariot.

The chariot drivers then develop

a relationship with a few specific

horses who alternate in service

on the chariot. They also train

their horses to respond to unique

vocal commands or sounds so

that they might use both hands to   attack  with  a  bow,  spear,  or  sword  rather

than holding the reins.

Design Notes: The first ability is a combat boost. However, keep in mind

that piloting a chariot may not always be practical depending on the terrain.

The second ability is your typical "Ace Pilot" style ability. Need to thread

the needle in a canyon? Need to weave through exploding rocks catapulted

at your forces? Someone trained as a saarathee (charioteer) can do it.

The third ability is supposed to represent that the chariot can be used as a

mode of transportation as well. The chariot can be used at speed if you've

got a clear path, or it might help when you camp to double as a shelter. On

top of that, riding in a chariot at speed can be liberating and invigorating.

If you're just enjoying the ride, take the momentum.

Quest: Hundreds of chariots are found at the bottom of a large lake. What

does local legend say about how they got there? If the legends are true,

what danger may now present itself to the region?

    SHISHYA

    It is considered a great honor to

    be selected as a student, or

    shishya, of one of the great

    gurus. Through their guidance,

    the pupil accelerates their travel

    down the path to enlightenment.

    The shishya often lives in the

    home of the guru and serves the

    guru's family in the menial tasks

    of cooking and home labor as

    payment for the guru's teaching.

    In this way, there is constant

    daily guidance and influence

    imparted by the guru.

    At times, a guru may assign a

    special task to a shishya that is

    designed for them to uncover an

    important truth about themself.

    Design Notes: Mechanically,

    the first ability is a way to earn extra experience after each vow and build

    momentum, but I like the narrative outcomes of this ability better because

    it encourages much more role-play through relationship building and

    internal conflict within the character.

    The second ability is like a specialized version of Sojourn but just for the

    student of the guru.Again, I wanted to incentivize more role-play.

    The third ability is also relational in nature as you share what you learned.

    Ideally, the listener sees your passion and recognizes the wisdom of the

    gurus in your words.

    Quest:Apast event weighs heavy on your heart that is impeding your inner

    growth. What was this event? Which guru are you seeking out to help you

    process this event, and what makes finding them a challenge?

22           THE TIGERLANDS | BASED ON INDIAN/HINDU MYTHOLOGY
RITUALS

The Tigerlands offer some unique rituals.

STOTR GAAYAK

In the Tigerlands, there is

widespread belief in a plethora

of divine entities, and some

mystics and priests can tap into

that divine essence using their

voice and only four sacred notes.

The resulting chants, or hymns,

contain power and wisdom

passed down from the heavens.

The most common use of these

chants  is      the  pursuit   of

enlightenment.       A gaayak, or

singer, will often find a reclusive

place for reflection and lay flat

on the ground with arms

outstretched as they sing to the

sky for guidance and insight.

In addition, there are more

practical uses of this magic such

bringing light to the darkness or

breaking a drought with gentle rains.

Design Notes: The first ability is similar to the core Augur asset, but the

trappings are different. The second and third abilities may be of more

limited use, but all of the abilities try to bring light to a dark situation in one

form or another.

There could be many more of these hymns in your version of the

Tigerlands, so if you'd prefer, grab the blank Stotr Gaayak asset card

included with the cards and fill out your own version for the pantheon that

fits Your Truths.

Quest: For the past few decades, an aged holy singer named Varsha was

able to carefully guide the rains to provide larger yields of crop during the

growing season. Now Varsha has passed into the next life, and none of the

singer's disciples are able to wield the same power over the rains that now

cascade down in an unending torrent as if angry at years of manipulation.

Why can the disciples not perform the divine chants? What sleeping

danger have the flood waters awakened?

    TAABEEZ NIRMAATA

    Tigerlanders will travel for miles

    through dangerous territory to

    gain access to a skilled amulet

    maker. These artisans are able to

    craft a necklace or totem infused

    with mystic energy of blessing.

    The lotus flower is viewed as an

    antidote to the stress of the

    world and a catalyst for bringing

    one to a sense of peace.

    Rudraksha beads are made from

    the seeds of the tree known as a

    Weeping Shivan and are used to

    make an amulet of protection.

    The Om (or Aum) symbol

    originated in the Old World

    whose meaning has been lost to

    time. In the Tigerlands, we take

    the symbol to mean "the infinite

    knowledge with which one is liberated,"  and  an  amulet  set  with  the  symbol

    is meant to provide wisdom.

    Design Notes: To be clear, you only roll +wits when you first make the

    amulet. That single roll determines the value of X for the rest of the life of

    the amulet. After that point, the amulet's power remains active until you

    roll a one on the action die while using it. In this way, an amulet is very

    much like a rarity as described in Ironsworn: Delve.

    The first two abilities allow you to create protective amulets. Personally, I

    would not let a character benefit from the effects of two or more amulets of

    the same kind. In other words, I wouldn't allow spam creating rudraksha

    bead amulets to get a +10 to Endure Harm. You may even choose to not

    allow a character to benefit from more than one amulet type at a time.

    I hope that the third ability makes it easier to gain some of that sweet XP

    from all those misses, but I also hope it leads to your character reflecting

    and experiencing growth. Each time you use it, think: What did my

    character learn that fundamentally shifted who they are? What was that

    shift, and how do I play it from now on? Note you'll need Delve.

    Quest: The Weeping Shivans in the area have been dying off as they

    succumb to a mysterious disease. Only one tree survives that is estimated

    to be thousands of years old. What about the disease makes you think it

    isn't natural? Who have you heard of that has mystic power over plants

    that may be able to help?

24  THE TIGERLANDS | BASED ON INDIAN/HINDU MYTHOLOGY
NEW FOES

The Tigerlands are riddled with small pockets of the firstborn. The stories

and myths that we took as fiction in the Old World have turned out to be

based in fact here on this continent. As such, we must be very careful when

we seek out new resources for survival because those resources are very

often already claimed by someone else.

Not only must we be careful to respect the firstborn boundaries and

cultures, but the animal life in the Tigerlands is diverse, dangerous, and

plentiful. Tigers and lions are in a constant battle for territory. Bears and

leopards both patrol the same territories that are free from the tigers or

lions. Crocodiles have adapted to salt water and will attack canoes or rafts.

Wild elephants go mad and trample whole settlements. Cobras can be

found in every nook and cranny despite the mongooses'best efforts.

This is a dangerous world, but it is our home now. We must press on.

Design Notes: Many of the mythological creatures I found while

researching were humanoid in nature with some animal hybridization

mixed in. I decided to make all of those type of creatures be firstborn for

this setting, but that may present a problem for players who utilize a

human-only version. To allow for this issue, I dug a little deeper into the

research and added a few more foes than I normally do so that there are

now at least a few in each category.

                Sting with venomous tail

    Tactics:    Slash and grip with pincers

                Impale with mouth blades

    When the ajakava scorpion are born, they are only about the size of your

    little finger, but they grow quickly into a giant hunter of the jungles. With

    a lifespan of decades if not centuries, we think that they never really stop

    growing. We have found molted scorpion shells the size of wolves, bears,

    and one the size of an elephant.

    Even the tigers will give these creatures a wide berth as their sting is

    enough to incapacitate an elephant. Couple that with their deadly pincers,

    and you can see why this creature is deadly for Tigerlanders. Moreover,

    the ajakava can easily attack multiple targets because they have evolved a

    secondary set of blade-like appendages near their mouth that they use to

    impale prey in place while they use their pincers or tail to attack others.

    The only effective strategy we have found to defeat an ajakava is to sneak

    attack it from the rear. Their stinger is jointed in such a way that it can only

    strike in a narrow arc in front of it. If you can begin a battle with an ajakava

    by severing its tail, you may have a moderate chance of surviving, but the

    best advice is to never engage in the first place.

    Quest: Ajakava, like all scorpions, have live birth, and each litter birthed

    usually contains anywhere from ten to forty young who swarm whatever is

    nearby for food. A bloated and likely pregnant ajakava bigger than any

    seen before attacked a small group of travelers stinging one of the people

    and dragging them off as the others fled. It is probable that the captured

    person will be used as food for the ajakava's soon to be born young. Who

    is the captured person? What makes the area of the scorpion's nest

    particularly dangerous?

    YOUR TRUTH

    Can ajakava burrow and tunnel underground?

            Breed

            Stalk prey from the shadows

Tactics:    Claw and bite

            Leap and snap the neck of prey

The baagh is dominant species of tiger in the Tigerlands. It is the largest

cat on the continent, slightly larger than lions, and also has the largest

canine teeth of any type of cat. Between their fangs and claws, the baagh

tigers are the royalty of the jungles.

Despite their size, the baagh is an adept tree climber. From their hiding

spot in low branches, they can pounce down on prey with enough force to

immediately snap the neck of their prey. Baaghs also are known to sleep

in trees to avoid being targeted by a stray ajakava or naag.

While they primarily prey upon boar, deer, antelope, ox or water buffalo,

the baagh has also earned the reputation of being a man-eater. This may be

related to their obvious similarities with the rakshasa firstborn, but there

have been many instances of Tigerlanders falling prey to a baagh.

Further cementing their status as the apex predator of the region, the baagh

tigers are very capable swimmers. They are comfortable attacking prey at

the water hole, and crocodiles usually will not attempt attacking a baagh

swimming in their river territory because even in water the tiger is deadly.

Quest: An aged baagh lives near a settlement who views the animal as a

guardian spirit. The elder tiger has gotten to the point that it can't hunt for

itself and survives only with the help of the Tigerlanders. The overseer is

seeking a group of hunter who will ceremonially lay the baagh to rest.

Despite it's infirmity, this is still a dangerous proposition. What happened

in your past that you owe a debt to the overseer forcing you to take on this

task?

Baagh have developed an unusual ability or characteristic.

What is it?

                Track and hunt with the pack

    Drives:     Scavenge buried corpses

                Howl at the moon, roar at the sun

                Pounce, rake, bite the jugular

    Tactics:    Imitate sounds of prey to lure them in

                Herd the prey to advantageous ground

    The crocotta has thin fur that is an ever-shifting gradient from gray to tan

    which allows them to better hunt both at night and during the day. They

    sleep in short periods throughout a full day so that they can maintain their

    lifestyle as both diurnal and nocturnal creatures.

    One of the most frightening abilities of the crocotta is their skill at

    mimicking sounds of prey they have encountered. Much like a lyre bird, a

    crocotta can convincingly sound like a crying child, a Tigerlander in pain,

    or another wounded animal in order to draw in their prey.

    They tend to hunt in small packs by herding their prey into an area where

    the pack can easily surround multiple prey and kill them all. Despite their

    pack nature, the crocotta have also been known to hunt alone. In that case,

    they often strike swiftly and without warning rather than herding prey.

    Quest: A pack of crocotta were spotted fleeing through the plains. What

    did the crocotta fear so much that they were willing to abandon their

    territory without a fight? How will this threat impact the local community?

    YOUR TRUTH

    Are the crocotta natural creatures, or were they originally

    made through the mystic arts?

Features:    Light green expandable hood with two dark circles

             Variety of coloration patterns on the body

             Sun and sleep

Drives:      Opportunistically hunt

             Mate

             Hooding, hissing, and raising upper body erect

Tactics:     Lull into a false sense of security before striking

             Strike once with venom and wait for prey to die

The naag is a very large hooded cobra with highly lethal venom. Their

front fangs are hollow to allow for swift injection of their venom because

they are unable to keep their fangs embedded in their prey. Naags have an

excellent sense of smell and night vision making them most dangerous at

night.

They rarely go out of their way to hunt since they can go days or even

weeks without eating, but they will opportunistically prey on any creature

who passes by. Their preferred tactic is to announce their presence with a

defensive posture of hissing and hooding. When the prey notice them and

start to back off, the naag will also back away slowly. This makes the prey

think they can skirt around the naag which is when it strikes. Amotivated

naag can cover two Tigerlander arm spans of distance in the time it takes

lightning to flash. Slower prey have no chance against such a predator.

Other than the shyena, lions and tigers are the best hunters of the naag

because they aggressively move in closer to the snake instead of backing

away. They then present a front paw for the snake to strike, jump up

slightly when the snake does attack, and swipe the back of the naags head

with their other front paw. A great cat can decapitate a naag with a few

iterations of this tactic.

Quest: A skilled snake charmer had an extremely large naag companion

that they traveled with to perform. In the last settlement, the naag turned

on the charmer before disappearing into the jungle. It now returns each

night to terrorize the settlement. What caused the swift change in the

naag's behavior to make it so much more aggressive?

YOUR TRUTH

Is there a species of naag that is a spitting cobra?

    Theshyenais aspecies of hawk said to haveoriginally spawned as servants

    to Agni, the god of fire. Legend says that in order to survive in close

    proximity to the god, their bodies developed a secretion with powers of

    rejuvenation. As they neared Agni, their feathers would burn off, but the

    oily secretion would rapidly regrow their feathers before they hit the

    ground.

    Whether the origin legend is true or not, this healing balm produced by the

    shyena makes them a highly sought after species for priests and healers.

    Moreover, it gives them the ability to prey on naags since they can be bitten

    but not feel the effects of the venom due to the revitalizing oil covering the

    wound.

    To produce the secretion, the shyena must fly to extreme altitudes. Some

    say this is the bird's attempt at reconnecting withAgni, but it is more likely

    that the changes in temperature or pressure trigger the production of the

    shyena oil. Additionally, the extreme heights give their attacks much more

    force as they dive bomb a prey and stab them with talons.

    Quest: A flock of shyena are known to nest in the nearby jungle and are

    protected by the local Tigerlander settlement. The birds have been trained

    to recognize a small group of falconers who can coax them to the ground

    for the shyena oil to be gathered without harming the birds. The last time

    the falconers went to the shyena nesting grounds, they never returned.

    Upon investigation, the falconers were found dead and the shyena nest

    abandoned. Who or what did this? How will the settlement survive now

    that their main trade good has been taken from them?

Tactics:    Slash with front hooves

The farasi bahari, also known as water horses, spend most of their time

along the depths of the ocean floors making sightings rare. During a few

weeks throughout the year, water horses will surface and head towards the

coast to graze on great blooms of algae. It is commonly believed that if you

can entice a farasi bahari to breed with a normal horse during these times,

the resulting foal will have enhanced strength and speed as well as a

shimmering green coat.

While not extremely aggressive by nature, water horses are easily spooked

and respond by attacking rather than running away. Their first line of

attack is to use their front hooves to slash or their tail to bash their foe. If

their opponent persists in the battle, they have special bones in their tail

allowing them to extend it long enough to coil around a medium to large

sized creature. After capturing a land-based foe, they drag it into the

deeper ocean waters to drown it.

Quest: A horse breeder claims to have successfully bred his mare with a

farasi bahari, and the foal did indeed have an emerald coat. However, the

foal was stolen a few nights ago. Who do you suspect the thief is, and why

do you think it's not a simple case of theft?

    The reachisey is a form of dragon that was long ago imbued with the

    characteristics of the lion and elephant. It's lion-like head and mane seem

    oddly out of place on the reptilian body but no more out of place than the

    short elephant snout the reachisey uses to drink the blood of its victims

    while it gorges on their flesh.

    At the size of a wyvern or large bear, the reachisey is a dominant predator

    in any region. However, their lack of cunning and stealth means that they

    can be killed by a large baagh on the prowl. We also exploit this lack of

    intelligence to lead reachiseys into traps or pitfalls where we can more

    easily kill them.

    It is said that the reachisey was once a pure dragon but was warped by an

    encounter with wayward arcane energies. If they were related to dragons

    or wyverns, the wings are no longer part of their anatomy, but the armor-

    like scales remain making this a difficult foe to take down.

    Quest: An arrogant warrior wants a suit of armor made the bodies of slain

Tactics:     Run down and trample prey

             Slash and rake with front claws

Sharabha are enormous, solitary beasts that are the size of the largest

elephant. Despite their bulk, they are able to fly with their feathered wings

albeit not very gracefully. It is doubtful that they could get enough altitude

to fly with just their wings, but they use six of their powerful legs to jump

into the air and begin gliding. Some claim to have seen a sharabha jump

high enough to clear a whole valley just by gliding to the other side.

This skill at jumping is also useful to them as they hunt. Their eyesight is

as good as an eagle or owl, and they can spot prey from afar as they are

gliding down after a vertical jump into the air.            They then propel

themselves straight down towards their prey crashing into them with

tremendous force. They spread out all eight legs as they land to distribute

the force evenly across their body so that the prey takes the majority of the

damage and not themselves. Still, it is common to see a sharabha with one

or two injured legs as the hunt is more important to them than safety.

We have learned to shy away from the mountainous areas of the Tigerlands

which is where the sharabha roost. They seem to have a penchant for

climbing to the highest peaks they can find, and thus, we avoid them.

Quest: A shunned and dishonored warrior has vowed to kill a rampaging

sharabha. On their own, this warrior stands no chance. How do you know

    There is only oneVritra, the great water dragon. It is more a force of nature

    than a beast, but none-the-less, it is a physical being. Its gargantuan size

    and ability to fly make it the most feared creature in all the Tigerlands.

    The only respite we get from attacks by Vritra are when it sleeps for years

    at a time after consuming great quantities of water. It can drink whole

    lakes in a few moments and will stop up rivers with earthen fortifications

    so it can drink all the water straight from the source. Settlements that one

    day are near a life-giving river may find themselves in a desert by week's

    end after one of Vritra's attacks.

    A cult of Vritra worshippers has sprung up in the Tigerlands claiming that

    once Vritra's thrist is satiated, it will take its rightful place in the pantheon

    and reward those who helped slake its thirst. The Vritran cult will spend

    years building great reservoirs of water as an enticing target for Vritra

    when it awakes.

    Quest: A priest of the Vritran cult claims to have found the place of Vritra's

Tactics:          Blind and stun

                  Create illusions

Some say the asura are demons who escaped from the underworld. Others

say they are divine beings trying to seal off the underworld. However, they

may both be wrong. It is possible that the asura are descendants of an

ancient people who were the first inhabitants of the Tigerlands, the first of

the firstborn.

Whatever their ancestral roots, the asura have an affinity for controlling

and manipulating light through mystic arts. To them, wielding a sword of

pure light is nothing more complicated than wielding a sword of steel, and

perhaps even less complicated in their mind. They can call forth powerful

motes of pure light, wreathe a shield in a protective layer of light, or alter

hues of ambient light so precisely that a person sees something that is not

truly there, merely an illusion.

Since we first became aware of the existence of the asura, they have been

at war with the devas in Patala Dvaar. As far as we can tell, this war has

been perpetually waging seen time out of mind.

It is rare that an asura will make their way south, but when they do, they

often tuck their wings tightly to their back or cover them with a cloak so

that they can pass as a Tigerlander. It is true that they are similar in

anatomy to us, but as we understand it, there are four genders of asura and

all four are necessary for procreation. They are nar, pun, mahila, and stan.

    Much like the asura, devas are at times called demons or divine but are

    likely descendants of an ancient people like the asura. Devas are especially

    attuned to water and can control or manipulate it even in the weather. They

    may call forth a rain storm to ground the flying asura during a fight and

    then flood the battlefield to drown the asura.

    While it would be foolhardy to label an entire people group as malevolent,

    there is a subset of devan society that worships Vritra as the greatest of the

    water gods who will reshape the world soon. The devan sect of the Vritran

    cult is happy to destroy parts of the world with the fervent belief that it

    doesn't matter since the world will all be reshaped and reborn in Vritra's

    waters anyway.

    From the little we have gathered about the devas, they are a single gender

    society that reproduces asexually. Their bodies go through cycles of

    needing to breathe more water and then needing more air with each cycle

    lasting months. During the water phase, the devan body produces the egg

    of their young, and during the air phase, they can choose whether or not to

    fertilize the egg.

    Quest: A wounded deva shows up at a settlement seeking asylum and

    protection from a band of asura hunting it. What object of power does the

    deva have in their possession that makes you wary of helping them? What

    would happen if that object fell into the wrong hands?

The elephant folk known as ganeshans are the self-proclaimed high gurus

of all the Tigerlands.  Their society prides itself on their wisdom,

knowledge and ability to apply logic over emotion to a troubling situation.

They are also known for their devotion to the arts, particularly that of

written epics. Their writing is widely recognized as some of the most

beautiful script in the lands.

It is possible that the ganeshans continue to thrive in such a harsh

environment as the Tigerlands due to their stance on maintaining neutrality

in all disputes. While their people are relatively few in number compared

to other firstborn or us Tigerlanders, they have nonetheless been able to

avoid tragedy in their communities through rational discourse and

compromise.

Those who test the ganeshans quickly find out that they are not only wise

but also strong and capable warriors when the need arises. Their warriors

are first trained with a spear and large shield, but many ganeshans quickly

trade the spear out for a staff in order to deal less lethal damage. Despite

this, being hit with a ganeshan staff is still exactly like being hit by an

    Our name for kimpurusha comes from the phrase, "Is it human?" When

    we first saw them from afar, we thought their manes were bushy beards, but

    we could also see the coloration of their fur and feline heads. We continue

    to refer to them as kimpurusha because they are unwilling to share their

    own language or culture with us.

    We do know that they are fiercely loyal to each other. The surest way to

    die in battle against these lion folk is to injure one of them which then

    enrages the others making them fight doubly hard. It is easier to set your

    weapons down and admit defeat before the battle even begins. At least that

    way you have a chance of being allowed to live and let go.

    The other thing we know is that there appears to be a strict pecking order,

    at least among their warrior groups. The apparent leader of a squad is

    obeyed without question, but a series of commands are then made by other

    kimpurusha in an orderly fashion that descend through the ranks.

The kinnara look similar to the mythical minotaur except with equine

features rather than bovine. Their legs have a similar musculature as a

normal horse which makes their stride length tremendous. On an open

plain, they can match a normal horse's gallop and maintain that speed for

nearly as long as their animal counterpart.

Kinnara usually live in small nomadic herds on the western plains where

they travel from place to place so that they don't reduce the natural

resources in one area too much. They set up colorful tents made from the

stalks of a wild grain that only grows in the west and can pack up their

whole camp on a few small wagons they hitch to their belts to pull.

While most kinnara herds are not aggressive, they swiftly become so if we

get too close to them. They wield wicked looking halberd and other pole

arms with deadly efficiency. Thus, we have yet to establish any formal

contact with their people, and we're quite sure that's the way they like it.

supply of a nearby Tigerlander settlement. Having never been exposed to

this disease before, it is running like wildfire through the settlement. Who

is a powerful healer that you know who may be able to help? Would the

kinnara have more information about this disease that you need?

YOUR TRUTH

Are the kinnara in your world more like centaurs? If not, are

they able to bend down to use their arms as another pair of legs

allowing them to run on four legs?

    Tactics:     Tail slap

                 Mystic arts

    Our current belief is that the snake folk known as nagas originated in the

    underworld. We don't know if they came to this realm to conquer it, or if

    they are stuck in this realm trying to get back to the underworld and need

    more power or resources to do so. Either way, encountering nagas is

    usually dangerous.

    They have developed a powerful longbow with slots to shoot multiple

    arrows at once. We're not sure how they have the strength to pull back

    these bows. It's possible that they have tendons that run through their arms

    all the way down their tails because they usually coil their tails as they fire

    the bows. Because of the extreme distance these bows have and their

    accuracy when using them, we often don't know that nagas are nearby until

    some of our Tigerlanders fall dead to their arrows.

    Very rarely we spot a naga who has smaller snake heads growing out of

    their necks. These naga seem to be treated with special deference and also

    seem to be their most gifted mystics.

    Quest: A group of nagas seem to be on the hunt for something. They are

    killing and pillaging their way through the area, but their battles seem

    secondary to them as they spend the majority of their time searching and

    sifting through wreckage. What powerful item is rumored to be in the area

    that they may be looking for? What could the nagas accomplish if they had

    control of this item?

    YOUR TRUTH

    What powers does a naga gain if they have snake heads

    growing from their neck? What does the number of snake

    heads growing there signify?

             Battle for supremacy

             Swift claw attacks

Tactics:     Vicious bite

             Martial arts styles

The rakshasa earned a reputation as "man eaters" early on in our

exploration of the Tigerlands. They love a good battle and often eat their

foes after a victory. Some say this is because they view burying the bodies

as wasting resources, and others claim its because the rakshasa gains some

power or wisdom by ingesting their enemies.

Tiger folk love a good competition whether it is who can kill the boar on a

hunt, who has the most kills in battle, or who can leap the furthest across a

mountain passage. While not foolproof, capitalizing on this need to always

be the best has saved the life of more than one Tigerlander captured by the

rakshasa.

During a fight, the rakshasa typically like to toy with their foe. Due to their

overwhelming size and strength, they feel confident that their foes will

usually go down with a single strike, and due to their agility and mastery

of martial arts, they are confident that no foe can strike them.

Unfortunately, their confidence is not unwarranted.

Quest: An aged rakshasa has abandoned their people and is offering to

teach Tigerlanders the secrets of their martial arts. What ulterior motive

might this rakshasa have? What series of unusual events has befallen the

last several pupils the rakshasa had?

YOUR TRUTH

Are the rakshasa actually a form of demon?

    Tactics:         Stout hammer blows

                     Overwhelming brute force

    The riksha consist of several different groups of bear folk. While it's not

    uncommon to see brown and black bear folk mixed in groups, the white-

    furred riksha rarely mingle with others. There are also tribes of bear folk

    with a bright sun burst on their chests and tribes with bear folk that

    resemble sloths.

    While each tribe favors different weapons, the adoption of the chakram

    seems to be near universal. With the strength the riksha possess, they can

    deeply embed the bladed discs into their foes and sometimes even cut a

    Tigerlander in two with a single throw. We believe their reliance on these

    weapons is due to their large claws interfering with the use of a more

    traditional bow and arrow.

    During our first few winters in the Tigerlands, we noticed that the riksha

    were never spotted during the depths of winter. We believe that they

    hibernate during this time, but we cannot confirm it because they often

    collapse entrances to their dens for the winter.

    Quest: One riksha tribe appears to have exquisitely crafted weapons

    including hammers made from an iron unlike any other previously seen in

    the Tigerlands. What is this new iron ore, and what properties does it

    have? What secrets to smithing iron do these riksha posses?

    YOUR TRUTH

    Aselect few riksha are chosen to not hibernate and assigned to

    guard the den during the winter. Is this position considered a

    great honor? If so, how are the guardians chosen? What are

    the effects on a riksha who does not hibernate?

Drives:       Defend their treetop homes

              Expand their jungle territory

              Strike with their tail patar

Tactics:      Use the trees to their advantage

              Swarm their foes

The vanaran people are masters of the jungles who build extravagant

homes in the canopy of the trees. They can travel long distances through

the upper branches of the jungle faster than others can travel by foot on the

ground below.

This style of swinging from the branches extends to their approach to battle

as well. They will crisscross the battlefield attacking with the patar held in

their tails, and if they end up on the ground, they juggle two patars between

their hands and their tail so that their opponent never knows where a strike

will be coming from.

It may be true that not all the vanaran people are competent explorers, but

many of them are. They seem to have some special knowledge as to where

the hidden ruins of the world are located and mount regular expeditions to

these locations. In fact, we will often track and follow their groups to find

these ancient ruins ourselves. While there is never anything powerful left

after the vanara leave a site, we can sometimes use the crumbling stone to

build with rather than trying to quarry new rock.

Quest: A vanaran expedition uncovered yet another site of ancient ruins,

but this time they didn't come back out. It has been weeks since we saw

them enter the place, and our scouts now assume the expeditionary force

perished inside. What sigil or iconography can be seen at this site that

points to dangers inside? What do you hope to find within the ruins?

    Tactics:     Touch with tendrils causing memory loss and confusion

                 Embed themselves in the chest of victim

    The ghostly lights of aleya are found in many of the swamps and marshes

    of the Tigerlands, particularly in the ghost swamps of Nadiyon Kee Maut.

    Legend says that these are the souls of fishermen drowned in the swamps

    whose only desire is to see others befall the same fate.

    Usually an aleya will simply try to confuse a victim's sense of direction in

    the hopes of getting them lost as eventually the victim will succumb to one

    of the myriad dangers of the swamp. However, sometimes an aleya will

    take more aggressive actions. If the light approaches close enough that it

    can brush its tendrils across your head, you are likely to be filled with

    confusion. You won't remember where you are or where you are going,

    and you'll likely allow the aleya to lead you to your death.

    The worst attack an aleya can make is to directly enter your body in an

    attempt to possess you. If this happens, your only hope is singing one of

    the sacred hymns until the aleya leaves your body.

    Design Note: You may treat an aleya like an anomaly instead of a

    traditional foe if you prefer.

    Quest: Aleya lights are known to haunt a nearby swamp, but recently five

    aleya each of different color have been seen working in concert. What do

    the different colors signify? Why are the aleya working together?

    Is there a physical center to aleya, or are they completely

Tactics:     Surround in a circle of fire

             Separate individual victims from the group

The haya siras are said be either tears ofAgni that fell to the earth and were

corrupted by contact with mortals or conjured servants of Keshi the horse

demon. Whatever their origins, these horrors are particularly dangerous

because of their speed. If they are not spotted in time, it is nearly

impossible to escape them.

Luckily, the haya siras can be temporarily removed from our plane of

existence. There is a physical core at the center of their flames that can be

attacked with normal weapons, but the mystic arts are a much more reliable

means of exorcising these demons. They fear the ritual retelling of the tale

of how Keshi was defeated, cower before the sacred hymns, and are most

vulnerable to water blessed by an enlightened guru.

Whether out of a sense of companionship or the desire to make life harder

for Tigerlanders, we have noticed that the haya siras often try to free our

horses, cattle, goats and other livestock. They will burn through any

restraints and then chase off the animals before turning back to deal with

us. For this reason, when traversing the swamps, we always blindfold our

horses at night so they are not as easily spooked.

Quest: A settlement was recently destroyed in a great conflagration set by

several haya siras. Another nearby settlement has decided to set out on a

mission to rescue the now free roaming livestock before they die in the

jungles. They have charms supposedly blessed with holy water to protect

them, but what makes you think the charms are fake? Who is going on this

mission that you desperately need to keep safe?

Was Keshi the horse demon truly defeated, or has the demon

returned for revenge?

    Tactics:     Swallow whole

                 Multi-tentacle strike

    Kala Bhakshak, the Time Eater, was said to be the one who would end the

    world. After all, time devours all things. Unfortunately, this legend is

    demonstrably true and evident in the Tigerlands.

    We do not know if there are multiple creatures that resemble the true Kala

    Bhakshak or if there is only the one that we continue to drive away from

    the material plane of existence at great cost. All that we know is that with

    many stout warriors, devout priests, master mystics, and wise gurus, we are

    able to defeat this horror at least temporarily.

    However, we know it is a losing battle. Each time a Kala Bhakshak

    appears, it is more and more difficult to drive away. It grows in power with

    each life it snuffs out. And dear gods, the screams. The screams of those

    who are ravaged by time in mere seconds while entangled in the creatures

    ghostly purple tentacles are sounds that haunt your nightmares.

    How or why Kala Bhakshak appears is a mystery, as are most things about

    the creature, but all Tigerlanders know that any feuds or battles are

    secondary to the need to defeat the Time Eater. When the call goes out, we

    all respond lest we all perish.

    Quest:Amystic claims to have a sample of phantasmal material taken from

    Kala Bhakshak the last time it appeared. When asked to destroy it, the

    mystic refused and fled. Several settlements have pulled together to put a

    bounty on this mystic and the sample before any experimentation can be

    done with the material. What doomsday cult is seeking to find the mystic

    for themselves in order to facilitate their research? What motivation do

    you think the mystic has to risk meddling with such a powerful substance?

Tactics:    Spray others with their own diseased       blood

            Raking claws of pestilence

A pishacha is a terrible foe to face in battle. They have no regard for their

own body and in fact are quite happy to be torn apart as it spreads their

sickness that much faster. Their only desire is to see the living suffer and

die the slow painful death of disease. All it takes is a single touch from a

pishacha to develop painful boils or a shriveled hand.

Not only can a pishacha incapacitate you with their supernatural diseases,

but their size and bulk make them a physical threat as well. They have

lanky arms with dagger-like claws on their hands that they wield

effectively in battle.

While we can cut down pishachas with blades, their ichor oozes back

towards the main body portion and slowly stitches the pishacha back

together again over time. They can never be truly defeated except with fire.

Their body is highly flammable and even explosive when exposed to too

much fire too quickly.

There are medicine men, mystics and gurus who have discovered effective

treatments for a pishacha disease, but the treatment involves rare and

exotic materials that must first be gathered. Additionally, the course of

treatment is painful in and of itself so that not all survive the healing

process.

    The yakshi are considered to be guardians of the forests, but each yaksha

    is unique from the next. It would be wrong to claim that all yakshi are evil

    forest spirits because a few yakshi have been known to help lost travelers.

    However, any individual yaksha can turn aggressive the moment it thinks

    you are an unworthy interloper.

    Most yakshi we have encountered patrol a small section of a forest. We

    don't know if they are tied to an individual tree or other aspect of the forest

    or if they are capable of leaving the area but choose not to. They do

    communicate in a rudimentary way, but we have found the longer we

    interact with them, the more likely we are to be found unworthy.

    When in battle with a yaksha, it can attack from any direction because it

    has the ability to "tree walk." The spirit walks into one tree and then walks

    out of a different tree that may be on the other side of a clearing.

    While the yakshi are non-corporeal in nature, it seems that weapons of iron

    have an effect on them. Additionally, their staves are made of true,

    physical wood. If they tree walk, they drop their staff. Many have tried to

    sunder a yakshi's staff, but this only enrages them more. It's best to drive

    them away with direct attacks or escape quickly.

    Quest: An ancient tree grows in the middle of the jungle and produces

    hallucinogenic fruit that is sought after for its uses in meditation towards

    enlightenment. However, the tree is diseased, and a yaksha has appeared

    asking for help healing it. What is needed to cure this elder tree? Why

    does the yaksha look familiar to you?

Some of the great gurus reach a higher level of enlightenment that

produces physical changes in their bodies. They no longer need food or

drink but can gain nourishment simply from smelling the fragrance of a

fruit tree or the freshness of a mountain stream. Their body ages much

more slowly, and they isolate themselves from most in society. We call

them the astomi.

Unfortunately, the strain of enlightenment takes a toll on the mind as the

body and spirit begin to disconnect from that which anchors them to this

world. As they strive for higher and higher enlightenment, they seek to

impart their wisdom to others in more and more forceful ways. We excuse

this behavior because we know the astomi are close to nirvana, but this

does not make them any less dangerous when crossed.

Quest: One of the astomi has wandered into the settlement and begun to

meditate in the center of the village. Many gathered to pay respects to the

enlightened guru and waited patiently for teachings filled with wisdom.

After two days and two nights, still without speaking, the astomi

approached one villager after another and sketched a symbol on their

forehead that glowed for a time before disappearing. Once the symbol

absorbed into their bodies, the villagers began committing violence to

themselves and each other as the astomi watched. What is this enlightened

one trying to teach the people? Is the astomi still aware of the mortal realm

or has their mind already passed on?

    The rishyasringas are those who have been touched by Yama, god of the

    dead and the first of those to die. Those who experience an encounter with

    the god often go into a fevered dream state for several days during which

    time a pair of antlers grow on their head. From that point forward, they are

    no longer fully human and gain the ability to look into the chaotic swirls of

    the river of fate.

    A rishyasringa may be sought out before making significant decisions, but

    many times the message the rishyasringa delivers is cryptic and not what

    one expects. Through a mystic ritual, they can pull visions out of their own

    mind and place them into the mind of one who seeks answers. Thisinduces

    a vision in the person and incapacitates them until the vision is finished.

    Unfortunately, the chaos that rishyasringas navigate can also drive them

    mad. The closer they get to breaking, the warmer their body gets, and a

    spectral flame begins to surround their body and grow. At some point, the

    rishyasringa can contain the chaos no longer, and their mind breaks. The

    energy of pure chaos then manifests as a blazing inferno around them as

    they destroy themselves and those around them.

    You may seek the wisdom a rishyasringa can give, but is it worth the

    potential cost?

    summoned you. They have a vision to share with you of dire importance.

    The messenger says the rishyasringa is near the point of conflagration, but

    in your dreams of late that give a clue to this vision? How did you know

    this rishyasringa before they gained their power?

    Are the antlers the only manifestation of a rishyasringa's

Rank:         Formidable (1 progress per harm; inflicts 3 harm)

                  Bulging muscles covered with sweat soaked fur

Features:         Stripes like a tiger but purple on sickly gray

                  Salivating jaw and elongated hands with claws

                  Stop the pain

Drives:           Destroy

                  Satiate bloodlust

                  Claw and bite

Tactics:          Pounce and rake

                  Ambush from hiding

Weretigers are a grotesque distortion of a Tigerlander who has been bitten

by a rakshasa or was twisted by a powerful mystic ritual gone wrong. The

person's body rapidly stretches and twists into a humanoid with the

strength and appearance of a grisly tiger.

Not every person bitten by a rakshasa turns into a weretiger, but we know

that it occurs with some frequency. If we knew exactly what the rakshasas

were doing to cause this reaction, we could put some protections in place,

but alas, we are powerless against this attack thus far.

When a Tigerlander turns into a weretiger after using a mystic ritual, it is

usually a ritual that has to do with imbuing strength. We think it possible

that these rituals are sabotaged by some unknown entity because the

transformation into a weretiger when these rituals go wrong also does not

occur every time.

Regardless of how it happens, one who has been transformed into a

weretiger becomes a killing machine roaring in pain and rage. They attack

whoever they can and at times run aimlessly through the jungles screaming

and roaring.

Quest: A weretiger was spawned after the last rakshasa attack, and now a

mystic in the settlement thinks they have a way to transform the weretiger

back into a human if only they can get the necessary ingredients and

capture the weretiger alive. Who was this weretiger to you before they

transformed that you are willing to risk your life to help them?

YOUR TRUTH

Are there other werebeasts, or are they always tigers?
