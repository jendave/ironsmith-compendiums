THE FIRELANDS

Inspired by Japanese Mythology
   THE FIRELANDS

   Each Flavor Pack for the Ironsworn RPG is inspired by some culture's

   mythology. The ideas presented are not exact duplicates of myths,

   cultures, or creatures from those cultures, but rather are general ideas

   meant to evoke a slightly different feeling rather than the viking-like

   setting of the Ironsworn core setting.

   The Firelands Flavor Pack was inspired mainly by the Edo Period in the

   history of Japan. However, some of the foes were inspired by more

   modern myths, but I did try to change them to fit in with a more medieval

   time period. I've done my best to treat the Edo culture of Japan with

   respect and hope that this supplement is seen as my admiration of the

   culture. Before using any of this content, please make sure that your

   players are in agreement with the type of game and setting you want to

   build together.

   Forced to flee the Old World, a group of desperate refugees made

   the dangerous trek north across the storm-wracked seas only to

   land on the shores of a new and equally harsh world formed by

   several still active volcanoes: the Firelands. This is a realm of

   flame and shadow, a realm where Old World myths come to life. It

   is unforgiving and cruel.

   Amidst this punishing environment, the refugees toiled to establish

   a new home, a place free of the problems of the Old World. They

   are now in their third generation and call themselves Firelanders.

   Every season, every day, is a struggle to survive, but the

   Firelanders have souls of iron and resolutely press on.

   Separate clans, usually headed by a daimyo or shogun, rule each

   small settlement or handful of settlements. The clans interact

   through a complex web of honor and intrigue while trying to

   advance their own agendas. Outside the law, bands of ronin roam

   and take advantage of the weak.

   Each clan mixes some of the traditions of the Old World with new

   traditions making protocol and ceremony vastly different from

   region to region. Only a handful of the ancestral spirits that

   typically helped guide society in the Old World have found their

   way to the Firelands, but they are still worshiped in some areas.

   Complicating matters are the new yokai surfacing here.

   Those who swear iron vows in the Firelands are sometimes called

   samurai. Failing to complete an iron vow means not only dishonor

   for the samurai but also for their clan.

1                   THE FIRELANDS | BASED ON JAPANESE MYTHOLOGY
NEW REGIONS

Each region in the Firelands corresponds to a region on the normal

Ironsworn map. In this way, you can continue to use the same map while

still getting a new flavor for the setting.

Within the Firelands, I gave each region a hopefully somewhat accurate

name using Japanese words, but I used Google translate, so please forgive

me for any language butchering! I only had a couple of years of Japanese

in high school! Also given are the English equivalent that I was aiming for.

The new region names are:

1. Barrier Islands  Chisana Hi (Tiny Fires)

2. Ragged Coast  Kokuyoseki No Ha (Obsidian Blades)

3. Deep Wilds  Kyoki No Mori (Forest of Madness)

4. Flooded Lands  Yurei Numachi (Ghostly Swamps)

5. Havens  Sakura Tani (Cherry Valley)

6. Hinterlands  Hai No Kawa (River ofAsh)

7. Tempest Hills  Madoromi Oka (Slumbering Hills)

8. Veiled Mountains  Geppu Kyojin (Belching Giants)

9. Shattered Wastes  Aka Umi (Red Sea)

   CHISANA HI                                                      TINY FIRES

   Replaces: Barrier Islands (Region 1)     

   Features:

     Tumultuous waves                     Hardy fisher-folk

     Powerful currents                    Daring pirates

     Unending lava flows                  Heat loving creatures

     Billowing clouds of steam  and       Shipwrecks that burn in the

      ash obscuring vision                  lava or languish in open sea

     Frequent tropical storms             Rough cliffs of lava rock

   Meaning Tiny Fires, the region known as Chisana Hi is a group of islands

   off the western coast of the Firelands. Nearly all of the islands have small

   active volcanoes or lava vents that can be seen from the mainland.

   Together, they light up the night sky with a myriad of red dots chained from

   the furthest southern tip of the Firelands all the way to mountainous region

   of Geppu Kyojin.

   The islands are populated mostly by brave fisher-folk who live atop the

   highest areas of cooled igneous rock where the active lava can't reach. The

   people of this region are said to have an almost spiritual connection with

   the volcanoes and have developed the mystical art known as Firebending.

   Those who practice this art have the ability to shape bits of cooling lava

   into defensive structures, beautiful totems, and even deadly weapons.

   Quest:Alegendary pirate crew is said to have hidden their treasure behind

   a waterfall of lava. They must have had a way to divert the lava flow to

   access such a location, but that knowledge was lost when their ship was

   lost at sea during a tsunami. The ghostly outline of one of the pirate crew

   has appeared on your ship offering to guide you to the treasure as long as

   it will be used to make restitution for their evil deeds. Do you dare trust

   this spectral vagabond?

KOKUYOSEKI NO HA                                           OBSIDIAN BLADES

Replaces: Ragged Coast (Region 2)         

Features:

  Sheer cliff faces of pitch black      Pirate ships outfitted with fuse-

  Depths beyond sounding                 lit rockets

  Pods of nure onna hunting the         Sightings of the mythical

   shores                                 Takarabune ship of the gods

  Isonade, hook-tailed sharks,          Precariously perched

   prowling the waters                    settlements

Meaning Obsidian Blades, Kokuyoseki No Ha, the western coast of the

Firelands, is filled with obsidian cliffs forming jagged fractals down the

coast that are sharp enough to cut through leather armor. The waters just

off shore plunge to unimaginable depths where it is believed the islands

of Chisana Hi were torn from the coast by a terrible earthquake leaving

behind the deepest trench in the sea full of unknown creatures.

The Firelanders who live in this region make their homes near

obsidian staircases leading down to the waters for easy access

to fishing and travel. The condition of these staircases is a

point of pride among the settlements. The more precise

and safe the razor-edged stairs are, the higher the honor

given to that settlement.

Producing the perfect staircase

takes years as the Enkei Ko, or

Rounders, dull, grind and polish

the obsidian steps. Each youth in

a settlement is mandated to spend

at least two years as an Enkei Ko

under the tutelage of a master. The

scars gained during these years are

viewed as a badge of honor, but lost

fingers or worse injuries are said to

indicate a misguided youth who is

forever cursed.

Quest: A trade settlement had two

separate ships surrounded by isonade

sharks who hooked the vessels and

towed them to an unknown location.

What was on the last ship taken that

you desperately need?

   KYOKI NO MORI                                        FOREST OF MADNESS

   Replaces: Deep Wilds (Region 3)                      

   Features:

     Dark forests nearly untouched             Ghostly forms gliding between

      by humans                                  trees

     Shadowy floor veiled by fog               Patter of rain

     Constant laughter of the trees            Places where pine trees should

     Evidence of firstborn                      grow but don't

   Kyoki No Mori is usually avoided by all but the bravest or most desperate

   Firelanders. It is known as the Forest of Madness because the ancestral

   spirits that inhabit this place are said to have gone mad on their journey to

   Firelands. Kitsune, Tanuki, and Kodama, if they truly exist, are said to

   have been here since the dawn of time and did not welcome the ancestors

   of the Old World.

   The trees here grow as if tortured in some way, all twisted, gnarled, and

   hollow on the inside. Their thin branches grow in such a way that they rub

   together in the wind making the sound of maniacal, staccato, wooden and

   unending laughter. "Ah...Ah...Ah.Ah.Ah.Ah." wafts eerily on the winds.

   Lingering fog, constant rain, and a shadowy interior make this place

   difficult and frightening to explore.

   Quest: Two children from a settlement on Kyoki No Mori's edge ran into

   the woods to play despite their parents'warning. Whenever a rescue party

   sets out, the forest's laughter intensifies so that they afraid to venture in lest

   they offend the spirits. Why are you willing to face the hidden fears of the

   Forest of Madness to find these children?

YUREI NUMACHI                           GHOSTLY SWAMPS

Replaces: Flooded Lands (Region 4)      

Features:

  Stagnant and fetid wetlands         Dangers under every log

  Rivers of mud and tar               Swarms of insects with

  Ponds with a thick layer of oily     hallucinogenic bites

   mud on top                          Clouds of green gas bubbling

  Salt water poisoning all             up through the muck

Meaning the Ghostly Swamps,Yurei Numachi is a bleak and desolate land

full of tar pits and suu doro (sucking mud) that have claimed many a

Firelander's life. Neon green gas clouds waft through the lands from vents

that are said to connect all the way up to the mountains of Geppu Kyojin.

No one knows what the gas is, but animals flee as soon as they see a cloud

headed their way.

It is taken as fact among the living that the dead roam these swamps. Small

shrines located throughout the area act as offerings to appease the dead and

also as landmarks to safely navigate the murky bogs and marshes. But be

careful: sometimes what is first assumed to be the light of a shrine ahead is

really a kodama leading you astray.

Quest: A hummock containing a shrine and marking a safe path through

the swamp has recently been flooded. A new path must be found for the

local settlement to maintain contact with the world at large. Straying into

unknown territory is always dangerous, but certain supplies can only be

traded for and are running out soon. Which way do you go?

IRONSMITH: FLAVOR PACKS                                                        6
   SAKURA TANI                                         CHERRY VALLEY

   Replaces: Havens (Region 5)                         

   Features:

     Long, humid summers               Large sections of bamboo

     Lazy creeks and brooks that       The smell of cherry blossoms

      feed into wide rivers             Wary clans holding uneasy

     Hills, valleys, hollows, and       truces

      forests provide many resources

   The Cherry Valley, or Sakura Tani, was thought to be our salvation when

   we first arrived. Cherry trees dotted the valley and bloomed in grandeur,

   but we have found that their season of beauty is far too short. While water

   and wood are readily available here, squabbles with ronin and the harsh

   heat of deep summer take their toll on each clan making their home here.

   Despite these difficulties, a handful of large wooden temples have been

   erected that many Firelanders will make a pilgrimage to in order to ask the

   ancestral spirits for protection throughout the year. It is said that if you can

   commune with one of your ancestral spirits here in Sakura Tani, the valley

   will be a place of relative safety for you and your family unto three

   generations.

   Quest: A huge swath of bamboo forest has been cleared and is being used

   to fortify a growing settlement. What makes you uneasy about the leader

   of this settlement? What about the other smaller settlements who also use

   the bamboo? Will peaceful relations be maintained?

HAI NO KAWA                                          RIVER OF ASH

Replaces: Hinterlands (Region 6)                     

Features:

 Thick, gray grasses reaching         No line of sight over the grasses

over your head                         Sink holes to lava tubes

 Sparse and spindly trees             Prowling gray tigers descended

 Isolated settlements                  from Byakko

Hai No Kawa, the River of Ash, is an ancient riverbed where lava once

flowed wider than any river of water ever seen. Legend says that theTengu

flew buckets of water from the seas over the lava flow for generations

before it cooled enough to become the bleak plains that it is today. Tall

gray grasses with shallow root systems now cover the area and hide a

delicate ecosystem within their blades with the gray byakko tigers at the

top of the food chain.

Traversing the region is difficult as travelers cannot see landmarks over the

grass. The animals of the region have worn dedicated trails through the

grass, but they crisscross each other to the point of being dangerous to

follow.

The few Firelanders who settle here labor for months to drag large tree

trunks to the area in order to build a home. They erect towers that stand

above the grasses from which they can hunt small game, and each tower

has its own shrine of carved igneous rock at its base. The most enterprising

people have cleared large areas of grass in order to plant the few crops that

can grow in such shallow soil.

Quest:Aparticularly large byakko tiger began to harass a small settlement

of a few families, and the adults went out on the tiger trails to hunt the

animal. When you arrived at the settlement to find only children, the adults

had already been gone two days. Do you leave the children to continue

fending for themselves in order to find their parents, or do you help the

children relocate to a safer place?

   MADOROMI OKA                              SLUMBERING HILLS

   Replaces: Tempest Hills (Region 7)        

   Features:

     Small deciduous trees giving          Rut-filled roads worn deep by

      way to smaller conifers                mining caravans

     Abandoned mines in the                Remains of ancient structures

      hillside                               that never dug their foundations

     Frequent minor earthquakes             into the ground

      said to be the rock giants rolling    Hilltops with perfect circles of

      over in their sleep                    flowering trees

   The Madoromi Oka, or Slumbering Hills, initially grew from the active

   volcanoes in the northern mountains. Covered in small growth forests,

   Madoromi Oka can is a slightly more hospitable environment than the

   grasslands to the south or mountains to the north, but this also means there

   are more people and creatures vying for the same resources. Oni and

   Tengu occasionally roam this far south, but more dangerous are the giant

   jorogumo spiders that make their home here weaving great orb webs

   between tree trunks that are said to be invisible until you are already stuck.

   Firelanders living here operate the deep mines providing the rest of the

   continent with iron and the ever-valuable nie iron. The hills themselves are

   said to be sleeping rock giants that will awaken one day if the mines are

   dug too greedily. Some claim to have seen giant skeletons known as

   gashadokuro that stalk the nights and are said to be the bones of one of the

   sleeping rock giants whose hill was mined to the point of their death.

   Quest: You come across a mining settlement with food stores still fresh but

   no Firelanders. There is no sign of struggle nor danger. None would

   abandon a working mine like this, so where did the population go?

GEPPU KYOJIN                                        BELCHING GIANTS

Replaces: Veiled Mountains (Region  8)     

Features:

  Towering peaks topped with             Shrieks of azure dragons and

   smoking craters                         phoenix

  Impossible landscape changes           Acidic lakes from noxious

  Lava flowing freely                     mountain streams

  Choking gas

Meaning the Belching Giants, Geppu Kyojin is a vast mountain range

housing a staggering number of active volcanoes that are said to hold the

nests of the rare fire birds known as kaen tori, the phoenix. Despite the heat

from the volcanoes, the area is plagued by perpetual arctic winds that make

this a region of both fire and ice. Thriving ecosystems live halfway

between a volcano's heat and the frozen, exposed mountain slopes.

Afew mining clans move into these peaks each summer, but run the risk of

freezing to death as it approaches winter or dying of heat exposure when a

mine passes too closely to a lava tunnel. Some clans, thinking themselves

clever, have built settlements dug directly into the mountainside to avoid

the icy winds and just close enough to lava tubes to benefit from their heat.

However, this is a dangerous position when a volcano erupts.

Quest: One of the Belching Giants has been quiet for so long that a

secluded jungle has grown within its sizable crater. What are you tracking

that seems to have gone into the crater? What have you heard is within the

jungle that makes you wary to follow your quarry?

IRONSMITH: FLAVOR PACKS                                                         10

       taller than a Firelander                from the lava

      Seas and rivers of lava                Desolation

    The lands north of the Geppu Kyojin are calledAka Umi, the Red Sea, and

    have layers of thick, broken glass covering the ground that reflect the light

    of lava lakes and rivers. Regular earthquakes rip great gashes into the

    terrain allowing seas of lava to bubble up that take weeks to cool.

    No Firelanders live here, but the few who have seen these lands tell stories

    of great beasts rising up from the lava pools and constant blizzards that turn

    to torrential rains near the heated ground. The land is said to be at war with

    itself, the ice of the air versus the fire of the earth, in a never-ending battle.

    Quest: Someone you care about set off to see the Aka Umi for themselves.

    Who are they, and why are you willing to follow them?

11                THE FIRELANDS | BASED ON JAPANESE MYTHOLOGY
NEW ASSETS

Just as the terrain and regions are different in the Firelands, so too are the

people and their skills. Here are some assets unique to the Firelands.

COMBAT TALENTS

Combat within the Firelands is usually a ritualistic affair, fierce yet

controlled. Honor must be upheld at all times. Deception, dirty tricks, or

taking advantage of an opponent of unequal ability or preparation is

considered dishonorable. Skill and precision are held in higher esteem

than simply winning a duel. Any savage brute can win a battle, but only

the greatest can win with poise, grace, and honor.

Note that not every weapon must have a combat talent. For example, you

might use shuriken (throwing stars), tessen (a fighting fan), or tekkan

(thick, blunt iron sword) as a weapon. While they may not have special

abilities, they can still be wielded by a character.

Additionally, you may want to rename some of the original Ironsworn

assets to fit into the Firelands better. Consider the following name changes

to weapons:

  Dagger - Tanto

  Staff - Bo staff

  Dual Daggers - Sais

  Axe - Ono, a Japanese stone axe

  Long Bow - Yumi, the long bow held two-thirds of the way down

   the shaft instead of in the middle

  Hammer - Otsuchi

  Armor - Do-maru for light armor (perhaps bamboo); Gosoku for

   heavy armor (full samurai regalia)

  Spear - Naginata, a curved spear; Sasumata, a pole-arm with a U

   shape at the end for disabling and incapacitating an opponent

    resolve conflict in other ways.

    As such, they hone their bodies

    to be in the finest physical

    condition so that their speed and

    agility can avoid any attack. It is

    said that they can unbalance an

    opponent with but the touch of a

    single finger and deflect any

    blow back onto the attacker.

    Design Notes: One of the

    struggles I had with creating this

    asset is that when you mark

    progress in a combat, you are

    inflicting "harm" giving the

    mental imagery of damage, but I

    wanted some way to win a

    physical fight without physical

    damage. Sure, you could Compel       or something similar,  but  I   wanted   a

    mechanic that would work with the    progress track.

    Thus, the first ability here lets you make progress in a combat with a

    different narrative flavor than physical damage. Instead of dealing bodily

    harm, you are wearing out your opponent, frustrating them, and turning

    their blows back on themself to the point that they finally give up in

    exhaustion. Alternately, you could envision this as using several small

    precision strikes to pressure points in order to disable or incapacitate the

    foe without doing any true damage.

    Quest: A daimyo has challenged you to a duel. To refuse would mean

    dishonor, but striking a daimyo is punishable by death. What happened in

    the past that made this daimyo want you to be in a no-win scenario?

13          THE FIRELANDS | BASED ON JAPANESE MYTHOLOGY
KATANA MASTER

The katana is the most widely

used blade of the Firelands. Its

balance coupled with its strength

make it the perfect weapon for

swift and precise strikes.

Those who train with a katana

not only train their body but also

their mind. They learn to be

patient in battle, waiting for the

right moment to strike a killing

blow. Their movements are not

rushed or haphazard but smooth,

calculated and efficient.

Design Notes: All three of these

abilities lead towards a powerful

combo of back and forth Strike

and Clash to gain the add +2 or

+1. Giving up the initiative on

a strong hit with Strike makes a

strong hit on the follow-up

Clash that much more likely.

Paired with the second ability, you are usually going to gain back the

initiative. This is meant to represent the idea that the katana master is

always in control of the situation. They think ahead and act with patience

and wisdom. They may even give up dealing harm to maintain that control.

Quest: The village of Takekabe sits on the edge of one of the largest

bamboo forests in the Firelands and is home to grand master Yatsuki, the

one who stopped an army single-handedly. Outside the main gate of

Takekabe is an obstacle course of sorts made up of several bamboo posts

and attached bamboo arms. When an opposing force showed up to siege

the village, Yatsuki challenged their general to one-on-one combat to

decide the fate of the Takekabe. Yatsuki vowed to only use a bamboo

katana while the general could use any weapon he desired. The combat

took place in the arena-like area of the bamboo obstacle course. Weaving

in and out of the posts with blinding speed, Yatsuki delivered blow after

blow to the ever more frustrated general who eventually yielded. Since

then, Yatsuki has been sought out as a teacher for aspiring samurai.

Now, Yatsuki has sent out a call far and wide seeking someone to replace

him as a teacher for he says he has a spiritual journey to set out upon. Why

do you need to reach Yatsuki before he leaves? Is there some secret

teaching you wish him to pass on to you, or do you feel called for a

personal reason to escort him on his upcoming journey?

    LEAPING DRAGON

    Some Firelanders use a set of

    razor-sharp claws to both fight

    and climb.      These tekko-kagi

    have a handle to grip and usually

    four claws that sit on top of the

    hand. Each claw ends with two

    blades: one pointed out and a

    smaller one (about an inch long)

    pointed down. Both blades can

    be used for slashing, but the

    smaller blades are used to help

    climb and also can be used when

    disarming a foe with a sword.

    The final piece of these weapons

    are the small diamond-shaped

    protrusions above the knuckles

    that function as a crossguard

    when blocking sword attacks

    and also allow the wielder to

    backhand attack foes.

    Design Notes:The first ability is

    same as the Duelist where you commit yourself to big hit, but it's less

    likely to succeed thereby leaving you in a vulnerable position.

    The second ability gives you a cool way to disarm a foe by catching their

    weapon within your claws. In the narrative, you can twist and break a

    blade or simply pull back with the downward tips of your claws to yank the

    weapon out of their hand.

    The third ability is when you climb up the cliff face or dig your claws into

    the wooden beams on a ceiling to suspend yourself in a hidden nook. This

    can be used in combination with the first ability to first climb up to gain the

    high ground and then leap down with a powerful Strike from above.

    Quest: The samurai known only as Kuzuri, the Wolverine, takes the law

    into his own hands as he travels the Firelands. While he serves a just cause

    and helps those who can't help themselves, the collateral damage in

    property and lives is often large. The shogun Ikeme Nawotsu has decreed

    that Kuzuri will either temper his justice with compassion or be sentenced

    to death. Now Kuzuri is on the run from both ronin and samurai. What

    side do you take in this showdown and why? What relationship do you

    have that is being strained by this?

OAKEN WHIRLWIND

While the nunchaku (two wood

rods connected by a short chain)

differ from the tonfa (a wooden

baton with a perpendicular

handle), they both are used

similarly in the Firelands as

blunt weapons with a flair for the

dramatic. The fast whirling and

spinning of these weapons ends

in one of two ways: your

opponent being impressed with

your control or your opponent

mocking you as you damage

yourself.

Design Notes: The first ability

allows you to use these weapons

in a deadly manner, but rewards

you for using them as a simple

weapon instead.      This is the

same as for a wooden staff.

The second ability allows you to knock a weapon out of an opponent's

hand or entangle it in the nunchaku chain. Alternately, you can spin the

weapons with such frenzy and gusto that the opponent is impressed or at

least held at bay for a moment allowing you to capitalize on their

hesitation.

The third ability is the classic spinning of the weapon to block an incoming

arrow or holding the nunchaku taut to absorb the energy of a katana strike.

The tonfa in the Firelands may even have a secondary perpendicular handle

on the opposite side allowing it to act as a crossguard of sorts.

Quest: Ruse Li, known as The Dragon, was a samurai master of the

nunchaku who roamed the lands dealing out justice fairly and against

great odds. His legendary weapons are said to have been blessed when he

spent time meditating in a hidden shrine to the dragon spirit from whence

he took his name. Why do you seek this shrine? What do you desperately

need to find there?

    SCORPION STORM

    A kusarigama is a kama (sickle)

    with a manriki-kusari (weighted

    chain) attached. When first seen

    in the Firelands, an observer of

    the battle described the chain as

    the tail of a scorpion and the

    sickle as the pincers.  Thus,

    users of this weapon learn a style

    known as the Scorpion Storm.

    Design Notes:The first ability is

    when you use the weighted

    chain portion of the weapon to

    wrapped around an opponent's

    weapon and pull it from their

    grasp.

    The second ability gives you a

    flexible use of Strike. You first

    swing out your chain and then

    follow it with a sickle attack, but

    it can be done in two ways.

    Rolling +edge is trying to get your foe in a favorable position which allows

    you to keep the initiative even on a weak hit. Rolling +iron is about ending

    the fight. You try to immobilize the foe to deal a finishing blow which

    allows you to reroll any challenge dice to End the Fight. (These moves

    should be familiar to any Mortal Kombat fans!)

    The third ability gives you a way to frame the fiction when fighting

    multiple opponents. Since you are using Clash, you've already lost the

    initiative meaning the foes are probably surrounding you. Swinging your

    chain out wide, you drive them back. In the process, you deal less harm,

    but it gives you the split second you need to regain your footing and go on

    the offensive.

    Quest: A sinister and powerful shogun with bands of vicious ronin is

    hosting a tournament for seven nearby settlements. Each settlement is to

    send a champion to compete in duels to the death, and the winner of the

    tournament earns the right to not have their settlement invaded by the

    shogun. What makes this shogun particularly dangerous so that the

    settlements agree to the tournament rather than fight back?

THRESHING FLOOR

The chigiriki started as a simple

flail used in harvesting grain but

evolved into a sophisticated

weapon by extending the length

of the chain and replacing the

outer wooden rod with a small

iron ball.  The chain is long

enough to wrap around arms,

legs, or weapons.

It is said that the Firelanders

who developed this weapon

were from a village where

having deadly weapons was

banned by a paranoid and

oppressive daimyo. An honored

blacksmith       of  the  village

claimed the iron ball at the end

helped with the threshing, and

the daimyo agreed to the

blacksmith creating many more

chigiriki for use in the general

population. After months of using the chigiriki for only grain, the people

became highly competent in wielding them and thus were able to lead a

successful rebellion against the daimyo. Since that time, the chigiriki has

spread widely across the Firelands.

Design Notes: The first ability is very similar to the Long-Arm asset's

second ability except that you won't be able to shove your opponent with

the chain.

In my mind's eye, I see the second ability as whirling the chain as fast as

possible to deflect arrows or entangle a foe's melee weapon. You may

chain (pun intended) the first two abilities together by first blocking an

attack with Face Danger and then disarming with Secure an Advantage.

The third ability is the same as the Thunder-Bringer asset for hammers.

While the chigiriki does not have the same mass as a hammer, the chain

and weighted iron ball give it extra momentum concentrating the impact on

a smaller surface area. In other words, it's designed to break stuff!

Quest: An oni with a huge flaming chigiriki has been ravaging a nearby

area. The oni seems to love destruction simply for the sake of chaos, and

no samurai as yet have been able to defeat it in combat. Someone you care

about lives in the next nearest settlement to the oni attacks and may be the

next target for the oni. Who is this person, and what do they mean to you?

    COMPANIONS

    While there are many amazing creatures within Japanese mythology that

    could be used as companions, I decided to focus on two: the dragon and the

    phoenix. The dragon presented here is different enough from the wyvern

    as described in the Ironsworn core rules that I wanted it to be separate.

    SUZAKU

    Also known as Ho-o or phoenix,

    the flame birds of the Firelands

    were quickly regarded as beings

    of near divine status descended

    from the great Vermilion Bird

    from whence they take their

    name. Their ability to consume

    themselves in a conflagration

    only to be reborn from the ash is

    legendary. Though they possess

    this great power, the flame birds

    of the Firelands are rare, and it is

    even rarer that one would bond

    itself to a Firelander as a

    companion.

    Design Notes: The first ability

    encourages you to use your

    companion to fight. They are

    like a ticking time bomb that

    explodes on death only to be

    reborn. However, on a miss they       may be dead    for  good,  so  think  carefully

    before allowing your companion        to take harm.

    The second ability bolsters your own fortitude when near death, and the

    third ability has your phoenix "flame on" during those icy cold journeys.

    Quest: A pair of suzaku were seen streaking across the sky between two

    mountain peaks in a complicated mating flight.            Now every hardy

    Firelander is out to find the eggs sure to be laid from this union. Who do

    you know that is dying and needs the down of a phoenix feather to survive?

19              THE FIRELANDS | BASED ON JAPANESE MYTHOLOGY
SEIRYUU

The Azure Dragon was a divine

spirit worshiped in the Old

World that had a long snake-like

body with four legs but no

wings. This being had control

over the rain and was attuned to

the season of Spring giving it an

ability to manipulate the energy

and      form  of   plant  life,

particularly wood.  When we

arrived in the Firelands, we were

shocked to find actual draconic

beings resembling the great

Azure Dragon of legend.

Like     its   ancestral   spirit

namesake, the seiryuu dragons

of the Firelands have exhibited

mystic abilities. They have been

known to call forth rain storms

to elude pursuers or thicken

bamboo stalks to impede a

violent creature. Being in touch with the spiritual realm, they can speak

with kami and have a particular disdain for horrors or any other creature

they see as an affront to the natural order.

Seiryuu are sapient, exceptional judges of character, and not aggressive by

nature. To befriend one is a sign of great honor to a Firelander, their family,

and their whole clan. The most powerful seiryuu can also form a mystic

bond with a person thereby allowing them to communicate mentally.

Design Notes: The first ability is intentionally vague so as to leave you

narrative room when using your dragon's mystic ability. Notice that the

language says "request" instead of "command" because having a dragon

companion is more of a relationship between equals.

The second ability is about using your azure dragon as proof that the old

ways still have power. Your connection to the dragon denotes a connection

to the world of kami (spiritual beings) and is a powerful symbol of the

honor you hold.

The third ability is a divine strike more successful against villainous foes.

Would your dragon refuse to Strike an honorable foe? You decide.

Quest: A rare seiryuu was captured by a cruel daimyo who forces it to fight

others in an arena for entertainment after the dragon spurned becoming

the diamyo's companion. Why is saving this majestic beast a particular

point of pride for your family or clan?

    PATHS

    Path assets in the Firelands often are associated with a specific teacher or

    school. When you take one of these assets, also envision how your

    character learned these techniques, who their teacher was, and the current

    circumstances of the school or teacher.

    BUSHIDO

    The path of the Bushido is not an

    easy one.      Firelanders who

    commit themselves to this life

    know that their word and their

    honor must guide all their

    decisions, great and small.

    While    most  Bushido            are

    excellent warriors, the heart of

    their training is the philosophy

    and discipline necessary to live a

    life bound by a code of honor.

    Some Bushido take up the

    lifestyle of traveling monks

    doing what good they can while

    others start their own schools for

    correcting and training the

    wayward    youths             of  the

    Firelands. The Bushido don't

    need powerful weapons to win

    physical battles. Instead, they

    first win the battle for the heart.

    Design Notes: The first ability is very similar to the Honorbound asset in

    the Ironsworn core rules, but this balances truth with compassion. There

    is also the nuance of a weak hit allowing a way for mild offense to be taken,

    usually unintentionally due to the complexities and variety of traditions

    throughout the Firelands.

    The second ability is when you face a nearly impossible situation because

    it is the right thing to do. To borrow from superhero tropes, it's when the

    Flash sees the black hole knowing he can't run fast enough to reverse it but

    still says, "I have to try."

    The third ability is you digging deep within yourself for that extra source

    of strength when attempting to fulfill a vow. What counts as "in direct

    pursuit" is intentionally vague so that you can define it in the narrative.

    Quest: A beloved Bushido monk has gone missing, and a handful of new

    students at the school are suspected of foul play. Why do you have a

    personal stake in finding the truth of the matter?

MASAMUNE

The art of forging the finest

blades is a highly esteemed and

competitive occupation. In the

Old World, none was more

famous for his exquisite blades

than    Masamune.  In    the

Firelands, his name is attached

to those who choose the path of

the forge to enhance their

combat prowess, success, and

honor.

Design Notes: Tiny writing.

Sorry! The first ability is similar

to the Wright ability, but since it

is narrowed down to only

blades, it also gives you a bonus

to Sojourn.

The second ability allows you to

permanently enhance a blade

with a bonus when it uses Strike.

Whether or not you're able to enhance a blade with multiple of these

bonuses is up to you in your fiction, but that's what I planned to do with my

story using this asset. I want to call special attention to the third option of

being named. I picture the +1 momentum as the blade gaining more

renown as it is used more successfully. I hope that leads to cool RPscenes!

The third ability, which must be taken last, gives your blade some imbued

mystical power. First, you can forge this weapon to take down a specific

foe not a category or type of foe. In other words, you can't forge a blade

to work against all horrors or all wolves. It would have to be forged with

a specific horror, like the banshee haunting Eagle's Ford, or a specific wolf,

like the dire wolf of the Haunted Forest of Kaizuki.

Alternately, the third ability allows you to create a rarity. For the full rules

on rarities, you'll need to have Ironsworn: Delve, but it's a great

supplement well worth the investment. The power you imbue the blade

with is up to you. It might be a flame blade, a blade of divine light, or even

a blade that glows blue in the presence of orcs.

Quest: A family claims to have had a true Masamune blade that survived

the passage from the Old World and was passed down through the

generations. However, that blade has now been stolen, and the family is

seeking assistance in tracking down the thief to recover the priceless

heirloom. What makes you think that all is not as it seems here?

    NINJUTSU

    Those who practice the art of

    ninjutsu are skilled at deceit and

    misdirection      making  them

    master    spies.  While   the

    Firelander mytthos of the ninja

    are black-robed assassins, the

    true practitioners of ninjutsu are

    much more subtle. They know

    how to be so bland, nondescript

    and unassuming as to go

    unnoticed. They blend into the

    background as unimportant and

    insignificant, hence their great

    power.

    Design Notes:The first ability is

    much like the second ability on

    the Infiltrator asset in the

    Ironsworn core rules except only

    about     spying  to      Gather

    Information. This represents the

    ninja ability to go unnoticed

    while performing recon.

    The second ability is all about the intelligent application of misdirection.

    You can hide in plain sight, pass yourself off as a nobody, make a

    seemingly impossible getaway, or even start a chaotic mob by making sure

    that people see what you want them to see and not notice your actions.

    The third ability represents one of the main tenets of the mindset of those

    who practice ninjutsu: learning from mistakes. When in cloak and dagger

    type situations, there is usually little margin for error. Therefore, if

    mistakes are made and survived, it is vital to reflect and learn. I hope this

    is an incentive to have some character growth in your stories.

    Quest: A harsh but fair shogun has a mole. While the people fear their

    shogun, they fear outsiders even more, and now outsider "liberators" are

    causing problems by intercepting supplies or patrols. The shogun will

    bestow great honor upon the one who ferrets out the infiltrator as the

    "liberators" have shown themselves to be violent at times. Which side is

    in the right, and can the conflict be ended without further bloodshed?

23                    THE FIRELANDS | BASED ON JAPANESE MYTHOLOGY
RITUALS

Ritual magic and mysticism in the Firelands has the trappings of elaborate

ceremony and tradition. Enacting a ritual is as much about performance as

it is about purpose. It is widely believed that the kami empower rituals and

that if the specific details of a ritual are not followed precisely, the kami

will bring about a more mischievous or even disastrous effect.

CHIKARA KOTOBA

Some of the Firelander mystics

have mastered the technique of

channeling their kiryoku, or

inner strength, with a ceremony

of deep meditation and resonant

chanting. This ability and those

who use it are universally looked

upon with favor.

Design Notes: For each ability,

it takes time (purposefully

vague) for the ceremonial chants

to be performed. The first chant

brings out the healing power of

mind over body. If you prefer,

as a variant you may use this to

heal  an  ally,   friend,  or

companion. My thought was the

time component would prevent

players from spamming the heal.

The second ability is like meditating and clearing your thoughts to

understand a situation better. Much like Gandalf taking a break in the

Mines of Moria before finally noticing the difference in the smell of the air

to point the fellowship in the right direction.

To have the third ability used as a blessing to a community is considered

an extreme honor. It is a declaration of honest friendship and pure

intentions on the part of the mystic and a reciprocal opening of hearts on

the part of the community. None would dare undertake this ritual in jest.

Quest: A grandparent-like monk was sought out for advice on building

peaceful relationships between several small settlements.       The monk

entered into a Chant of Clarity and has not emerged from their meditative

state in several days. The monk still breathes every few minutes, but many

believe the monk's spirit is traveling on an ethereal plane and got lost while

searching for answers. Is there a way to bring this venerated monk back

to the real world, and why did their spirit linger so long in the other realm?

IRONSMITH: FLAVOR PACKS                                                         24
    HI MAGARU

    The firebenders have an innate,

    spiritual connection to the very

    essence of fire. They can mold it

    and shape it in the same way a

    blacksmith lovingly crafts a

    blade. For a blade is definitely

    what the firebenders wield, a

    weapon of flame.

    It is rumored that there are other

    elemental benders out in the

    wilds of the Firelands. Each one

    of the waterbenders, airbenders,

    and  earthbenders.have   been

    reported at one time or another,

    but only time will tell if they are

    truly part of this world as much

    as the fires that make up the

    heart of the Firelands.

    Design Notes: The first ability

    lets you bring in the essence of

    fire into yourself and powers your Strike. Note that it does 3 harm, more

    than a typical deadly weapon, but it is limited by the amount of energy you

    draw into yourself when you first utilize this ritual.

    The second ability adds Clash to your arsenal, but again it's limited by the

    amount of energy you have. Also, both abilities roll using +energy, so the

    more you use it, the less likely it is to work. If you miss using either of

    these abilities, it may make sense to take some harm yourself which can be

    another balancing tool at your disposal.

    The third ability lets you conjure fire from nothing. Hence, the large -2

    energy cost instead of only a -1. The way this fire is used to Secure an

    Advantage or Face Danger is left intentionally vague. It could be a flash

    of fire that distracts or momentarily blinds foes, a thin shield of heat to

    shelter from a blizzard, or a small fire that burns through the rope to launch

    you from a catapult to escape the walled city of the shogun who wants you

    dead. The possibilities are endless.

    Quest: A cult has sprung up around a supposed waterbender with the goal

    of dousing all the fires powering the volcanoes of the Firelands. While this

    seems a ludicrous undertaking, a small volcano in the southern Geppu

    Kyojin was just extinguished causing great earthquakes and flurries of

    frozen ash that blot out the sun. Can this cult be stopped? What is their

    ultimate purpose for deactivating volcanoes?

KAMI SASAYAKU

Kami whisperers are held in

both honor and fear.        Honor

because they can communicate

with the divine spirits but fear

because those communications

do not always go so well. The

kami can be fickle and at times

seem to provide guidance or

mischief randomly. The wise

kami whisperers endeavor to

learn all they can about the

spirits in a region before

attempting communication in an

effort to pacify their whims and

honor their willingness to speak

with mere mortals.

Design Note: I envision the

kami of the Firelands more as

divine spirits than as the gods of

the Shinto religion. Please be

respectful of your players using

this asset as their vision may not  be  the  same.

The first ability is meant as a way for mystics to recharge their energy

through communion with the kami. As a kami whisperer, just being in their

presence brings some comfort. My intention was that this could be not

repeated over and over again in the same region as that would anger the

kami for wasting their time.

The second ability allows a deeper communication rather than just basking

in the presence of kami. Vital information can be gleaned from a kami

spirit, but it can be difficult to interpret at times. A spirit of the air may

communicate quickly with emotion and color rather than words while a

spirit of the earth may not understand the concept of time. While useful,

the potential for misunderstanding this communication is always a danger

that kami whisperers risk.

The third ability is like having a personal guide through a region, but again,

that guide may not think the way Firelanders do. For example, a water

spirit may expect you to cross a river of raging rapids the same way that

they do by merely walking atop the waves.

Quest: The kami in a nearby region were always venerated and had a

positive symbiotic relationship with the people. However, the kami are now

becoming weaker and weaker and can't explain why. What has happened

to the kami, and can it be reversed?

    The foes of the Firelands are as varied as the cultures of the Firelands. You

    may find yourself pitted against animals, beasts, horrors, and even other

    Firelanders. Steel yourself, for these foes lack not for strength or wit.

    As mentioned earlier, these foes were taken from many different time

    periods of myths in Japanese history. As such, they normally would not all

    be found together, but I've endeavored to make them all fit into the world

    of the Firelands coherently.

    Additionally, these foes are not the exact same as their namesakes, but that

    was the starting place for creating a foe that fit the Ironsworn system and

    Firelands setting. For example, some foes take their name from yokai or

    other more powerful beings but have been adjusted into fantasy animals or

    beasts to round out the types of foes you can encounter.

            Silently stalk prey from within the gray grasses

Tactics:    Pounce, bite, and rend

            Make a show of dominance

The gray tigers of the Hai No Kawa grasslands are said to be descended

from the Great White Tiger, Byakko himself. As such, we have taken to

calling them by that name and give these tigers the respect they deserve and

demand with their deadly skills.

The tigers make their dens in sink holes or ancient lava tubes within the

ground. Sometimes the tigers need not hunt because their prey falls into

their den by taking a careless step forward without checking the ground

ahead first. You have heard the phrase, "Look before you leap," but in the

Hai No Kawa we say, "Search before you step."

The byakko have superb senses of sight, smell, and hearing that allow them

to pinpoint prey within the grasses ahead. They then leap forward and

pounce atop the back of their prey in an effort to snap their neck. If that

doesn't lead to an instant kill, they bite the prey on the neck to hold them

in place while their sharp claws rake and rend.

Quest: A strange shaman with a byakko cloak claims to be able to traverse

the Hai No Kawa without being accosted by the tigers. Wherever the

shaman goes, the byakko are mysteriously absent. How did the shaman

come by such knowledge, and where do you need the shaman to take you

that no one else has been able to find?

YOUR TRUTH

Do the byakko tigers have any supernatural abilities that were

passed on to them by the Great White Tiger? If so, what are

they?

    Tactics:    Bite

                Cut small boats in half

    Crossing the sea from the Old World to the Firelands was a battle we

    thought unwinnable. The distance we needed to sail was unknown, fresh

    water and food supplies were scant, and we were hunted by the isonade.

    The isonade are sharks nearly the size of a longboat whose tail is covered

    with several bony hooks with barbed ends. They use the hooks to snag

    their prey and drag them underwater rapidly changing depths so that the

    prey passes out. Once they free their prey from their tails, they feast with

    a frenzy so that no other fish can benefit from their kill.

    During our crossing, the isonade would lash their tails over the sides of the

    ship to hook us and drag us from our vessels. Failing that, two would work

    in concert to latch their tails onto the side of our ships and split the bow in

    twain. As a whole ship would begin floundering, we could do nothing but

    watch and listen in horror as our family and friends were silenced one by

    one. It is said that the isonade developed a taste for our blood those long

    years ago and can now smell us when travel the seas.

    Quest: Within the Chisana Hi roams a legendary isonade known as the

    Hari Ken, the Hooked Sword. It has grown cartilage like a suit of armor

    and threatens all trade and travel in the area. Can this beast be stopped?

    YOUR TRUTH

    The isonade travel and attack most often during violent storms

    at sea. Do they hold some power to control or call the storms,

    or are they merely instinctively following the storms?

Drives:      Forage for food

             Ride on whirlwinds

Tactics:     Knockdown and rake

             Slash ankles to numb feet of victim

Upon arriving in the Firelands, one of the first creatures we noticed was the

kamaitachi, an usual weasel with bony blades instead of paws. These

creatures run circles around their prey slashing as they go. The blades have

a secretion on them that act as a numbing or paralyzing agent that is

particularly effective against the small to medium animals that the

carnivorous creatures hunt.

When they attack, kamaitachi have been known to move so fast as to stir

up tiny dust devils which is where the story of riding on whirlwinds came

from. As far as we can tell, they hold no true mystical power over the air,

but they can propel themselves at great speed and even spin their bodies

about balancing on one blade while slashing with the other three.

The creatures are also very territorial particularly when it comes to mating.

The male kamaitachi are known to attack males of almost any other

mammalian species including Firelanders.

Quest: A storied ronin is hunting kamaitachi to create tekko-kagi claws

from their blades, but the locals know that the creatures are merely part of

the ecosystem and don't want to offend the kami or stir up any yokai. Can

the ronin's quest be stopped in a manner that is agreeable to all sides?

YOUR TRUTH

Are kamaitachi supernatural creatures or animals of unusual

heritage?

    Tactics:         Release a blood-curdling scream

                     Trap in web and bite with poison

    The jorogumo spiders are as large as harrow spiders but much stranger. As

    near as we can tell, the first several hundred years of a jorogumo's life is

    spent inside a cocoon webbed so tightly that it may as well be armor of the

    thickest iron, but somehow it keeps expanding. Once the giant spiders

    break free, their abdomens are warped and twisted with age, their heads

    have the look of a maiden's head only misshapen, and their chelicerea

    (fangs) begin rubbing together making the scream of a demon.

    As these spiders gain more experience outside of their cocoons, they can

    rub their fangs in such a way as to mimic basic sounds. Many miners have

    lost their lives delving to find what sounds like a lost comrade only to come

    face to face with a jorogumo.

    Once they escape the deep places of the world, they move into thick woods

    and spin web after web in huge spiral patterns. Some of the largest webs

    when viewed from a distant hilltop resemble a giant sea shell spiraling ever

    outward.

    Quest: An ancient jorogumo has taken a great warrior captive but is not

    feasting on the flesh. Instead, the warriors screams and cries for help can

    be heard for miles. The speech is too intelligible to be the spider mimicking

    the sounds. Who is this warrior to you, and why would you risk your life

    to save them?

    YOUR TRUTH

    Some say the first jorogumo was truly a woman cursed by a

    powerful mystic. Who believes this is true and what are they

    doing to try to reverse the curse?

On the coasts of Kokuyoseki No Ha, vampiric sea serpents lie in wait

among the obsidian shards for unsuspecting Firelanders to feast upon. But

these aren't normal sea serpents. Like the jorogumo, these creatures have

a vaguely feminine humanoid face, but their mouth is lined with fangs that

they use to drain the blood from victims.

Worse yet there are two varieties of nure onna, and the second kind has

fledgling arm-like appendages just below its jaw that it uses to hold down

its prey. Both varieties have muddy brown colored scales and are excellent

swimmers.

Quest: The merchant ship Hi Uku was shipwrecked on one of the Chisana

Hi islands, and the vessel carried the local daimyo's spouse as well as

goods needed for survival. Unfortunately, the vessel ran aground in an

area known to be infested with nure onna. If the passengers survived the

sea snakes, the volcano would be the next immediate danger. Who or what

else was on the ship that makes you want to help with the rescue?

Are the nure onna faces truly human?       If so, how did this

amalgamation of a beast come about?

    Tactics:           Pounce and claw

                       Retreat from powerful foes

    The people known as the Kappa are reptilian humanoids with a penchant

    for mischief and murder. They live in bogs and swamps using the

    landscape to their advantage when hunting Firelanders. Their claws are

    sharp as well as their beaks making them fierce fighters, particularly when

    they are cornered.

    The Kappa also have some innate waterbending powers that we think

    stems from the water inside the depression at the top of their skull. Once

    they have drained blood from a victim, they then use a dark ritual to force

    the person's soul into a tiny gem that they let soak in their head water.

    There are three ways to defeat the Kappa. First, travel in large groups as

    they readily retreat from a battle they know they will lose. Second, trick

    them into dumping out the water on their head causing them to freeze in

    place until the water naturally refills. Third, believe it or not, throw them

    a cucumber. They can't resist them.

    Quest: A survivor of a Kappa attack was found with only minimal amounts

    of blood drained, but they are completely unresponsive leading the local

    mystic to believe their soul has already been trapped inside the Kappa's

    gem. Who is this person to you that you would undertake the quest to find

    their soul and return it to their body?

    YOUR TRUTH

    Do the Kappa live in large communities, or are they a solitary

    people?

    What do the Kappa use their soul gems for?

            Protect the plains and woods

            Run away in fox form

Tactics:    Use tails in battle

            Trip and pounce

Running into the Kitsune people is considered a sign of good fortune.

They rarely involve themselves in the affairs of Firelanders unless we

threaten their homelands in some way. More often we encounter them as

we find ourselves the object of their practical jokes. They are not malicious

in any way, but they do enjoy a good laugh at someone else's expense.

The Kitsune also have the ability to change shape from their humanoid

form to a fully fox form. We believe there is a correlation between how

many tails they have and how powerful their magic is. Not only do their

tails tie into their magic, but they also use them when fighting in their

humanoid form to pummel and confuse their foe.

We don't know much about the religion of the Kitsune people other than to

know that they take it very seriously. There is a deep spiritual connection

between the Kitsune and the plains and woods of the Firelands. Stories

abound of Firelanders catching fleeting glimpses of elaborate Kitsune

ceremonies before they fall asleep as if by magic. And magic it surely is

because every witness also claims to see the Kitsune's tails begin dancing

in arcane gestures before they fall asleep.

Quest: A Kitsune stood outside of a local settlement and demanded the

Firelanders stop planting so many crops as it was ruining the land. They

were reasonable knowing that the people need food, but insisted the farms

be scaled back. Why is brokering a peaceful solution here so important?

YOUR TRUTH

Do the Kitsune grow more tails as they age, as they gain

magical power, or are they born with a specific number of tails

that never changes?

                Lead travelers astray

    Tactics:    Overwhelm with sadness

                Cannot be physically attacked

    If the Kodama truly are a people, they are unlike anything we've seen

    before. They primarily manifest as ghostly lights flickering in the distance

    to lead Firelanders away from their sacred spaces, but at times they

    manifest as vaguely humanoid with cloudy ovals for body and head along

    with cylindrical appendages.

    Our mystics have worked in concert with druids to divine what they can

    about the Kodama, and they believe the Kodama are either non-sentient or

    have some sort of collective consciousness shared between them. At first

    we thought they protected all the deep forests of the Firelands, but it seems

    more likely that they protect specific trees or groves. However, we don't

    know how they are assigned those trees or if they choose them.

    Travelers who have refused to follow the ghostly lights away from sacred

    spaces are quickly surrounded by the Kodama who then manifest more

    fully. In the presence of these more fully formed Kodama, our people

    report feeling overwhelming sadness and grief to the point that they

    willingly flee the area.

    Quest: A woodsperson from a local settlement went missing nearly a week

    ago and was just spotted in the middle of a ring of Kodama at the bottom

    of large hollow. The woodsperson is still alive but writhing and moaning

    in pain and grief. What relationship does this woodsperson have with one

    of your allies, friends, or companions that you are willing to attempt the

    quest to save them?

    a collective one?

Tactics:    Enlarge body parts to smother foe

            Double hanbo strike

At first glance, the Tanuki people are similar to the Kitsune. From our

perspective, they are both animal-type people, they both can shapechange,

and they both love jokes. However, where the Kitsune have a positive

connotation, the Tanuki have a negative one. Without a guiding principle

like the Kitsune's religion, the Tanuki people have a society based more

around greed, gluttony, and guffaws.

The Tanuki also don't really shapechange but shapeshift. They can

elongate, or shift, their body parts like great sails of ships unfurling.

Perhaps as a consequence of their society or perhaps a consequence of

biology, the male Tanuki favor enlarging their scrotums to smother and

suffocate their foes. Needless to say, this is a humiliating way to die and

brings dishonor on the whole family and clan.

While their preference is to use their shapeshifting abilities, when faced

with a truly formidable foe, mostTanuki are skilled in the use of the hanbo,

a small wooden shaft slightly longer than a Firelanders forearm. Their

favorite victory celebration is drumming on the buttocks of a defeated foe.

Again, they enjoy bringing shame to others.

Quest: A group of Tanuki were floating down river on a boat of their own

elongated body part when they decided to enlarge their body parts even

more to block the path of the river. Now the water flows toward a low-lying

settlement. Can the river be restored to its normal course before its too

late? Who do you know that lives in this settlement?

    Tactics:    Drop rocks on victims

                Flock together to overwhelm

    The Tengu people are avian in nature, but their bodies are not covered

    entirely in feathers. If it weren't for their red skin, wings, and comically

    long noses that may be an evolution from a beak, they could almost pass as

    a Firelander. Their feathering comes down from the top of their head to the

    back of their neck and shoulders before joining with their wings.

    Tengu are an ancient people who see it as their sacred duty to protect the

    mountains. As such, they dwell mainly in the Geppu Kyojin region and

    very much frown upon outsiders. They view us Firelanders as invaders and

    usurpers to the natural order. Miners and travelers are often met with a hail

    of arrows or rocks from above rather than a cordial greeting.

    One weakness or point of negotiation we can use with the Tengu is their

    love of treasure. Their self-imposed exile to the mountains limits their

    resources, so trade goods or items from the southern reaches of the

    Firelands are desirable gifts for them.

    Quest: A group of Tengu warriors have disrupted a mining camp just as

    they struck a vein of the precious nie iron. Is there any way to negotiate a

    truce, even if temporary, to be able to access the valuable ore?

The Oni may or may not be related to the Tengu as they both have red skin

and protect the mountains, but the similarities stop there. Where the Tengu

view protecting the mountains as a sacred duty, the Oni seem to

accidentally protect mountain regions because they attack nearly anything

that gets close to them.

It said by our mystics that the Oni are either demons themselves or direct

descendants of demons. Their towering size and immense strength are

impressive enough, but some also have some rudimentary firebending

magic skill that seems to be evidence of their connection to their demonic

origins.

A rampaging Oni is nearly a death sentence for a group of traveling

Firelanders. They view all other life as subservient to them and even a

version of heresy that needs punished. They believe the greatest good they

can do is cause others to suffer.

Quest: One particular Oni in a nearby region is calmer and more

thoughtful than most. It does not attack randomly or without cause and

seems to be guarding some hidden treasure in a mountainous cave. What

item do you suspect to be in this cave system thought lost to time? Why are

    from the date of their death they claw their way back out of the ground as

    a hone onna. Their only thought is to be reunited with their lost loved one.

    This story almost sounds heartwarming except that the hone onna are

    decayed and desiccated remains that slowly drain the life from their former

    lovers. Worse yet, the living soulmate sees the hone onna not as an

    animated corpse but as the love they remember best. They willingly fall

    into the arms of what they view as their loved one returned to them alive.

    Then over the course of days or weeks, they are slowly drained of their life

    and soul one kiss at a time.

    The only reliable way to be rid of a hone onna is to wait for their soulmate

    to die as well. However, that is not an acceptable solution, so we fight

    when we find them, but the hone onna fight back with fire magic that stems

    from their paper lanterns. Since they have physical bodies, a hone onna

    can be destroyed, but the living soulmate is rarely thankful as they would

    have preferred death in the arms of their loved one.

    Quest: A daimyo's daughter has returned as a hone onna, but the daimyo

    has forbidden anyone from striking the horror. The daimyo was disgraced

    when his daughter absconded with a lowly peasant's son and would rather

    see the son die than his daughter's ghostly remains harmed. The family of

    the boy has put out a call for help. How do you know this family, and why

    are you willing to help them?

    YOUR TRUTH

    Some remaining soulmates stand at their lover's grave on the

    one year anniversary in hopes of dying when they return as a

    hone onna. In what culture is this practice accepted?

Rank:     Troublesome (3 progress per harm; inflicts     1  harm)

            Blob creature that smells of death

Features:   Giant face for a body with stubby legs

            Dance in graveyards and temples

Drives:     Absorb more flesh

            Jump on and smother

Tactics:    Overwhelm with smell

            Melt into the ground

Nuppeppo are in essence the left over fats and body fluids from the dead

congealed into a bulbous body that resembles a giant face. They are gross

and a mindless nuisance more than a true threat. If our mystics could

discover how they are created, we would do what we could as a

preventative measure much as we do with mice in the grain bin.

Particularly when the moon is in a specific phase, nuppeppo will ooze forth

from graves and congeal into bodies so that they may dance throughout the

night and continue to grow as they absorb more and more organic material.

We have taken to putting fences around our graveyards to keep the

nuppeppo in while they frolic the night away.

Some mystics believe that the "flesh" of a nuppeppo has curative

properties, but few are willing to test this hypothesis. Of the many strange

and horrible things in the Firelands, the nuppeppo are easy enough to

ignore and so, often are.

Quest: The site of a large battle has a mass grave that is now a place where

several nuppeppo appear nightly. However, these nuppeppo are much

more violent than normal. Someone you knew and cared about fell at this

battle. What secret did they take with them to the grave that you hope to

unravel by stopping these nuppeppo?

YOUR TRUTH

What causes some graveyards to have nuppeppo and others to

not? Is there a difference in the way the people died or the way

they were buried?

    Tactics:        Wrestle and squeeze to death

                    Retreat to an ethereal realm

    The first nuribotoke showed up in the region of the Obsidian Blades coast,

    and we thought the near obsidian skin of these horrors was related to that.

    Alas, we were wrong as the nuribotoke have been spotted throughout the

    Firelands. They can enter the mortal realm through collective shrines left

    unattended or open cabinets of personal shrines within a home.

    The pungent odor is the first sign of the approaching nuribotoke usually

    followed by whispers of dark prophecies meant to plague the minds of

    Firelanders.     Once we are reduced to a pile of quivering fear, the

    nuribotoke reveal themselves fully with dangling eyeballs and flabby skin

    touching their scaly catfish tail. That's when they physically attack by

    squeezing with the might of a giant python.

    We don't know how nuribotoke are created nor their ultimate purpose, but

    as physical horrors, they can be killed if their fear can be resisted.

    However, once they see they may lose a fight, they begin frantically

    looking for a way back to the realm from whence they came.

    Quest: One particular shrine was cursed by a zealot to bring out

    nuribotoke every night, but the mystic caretaker of the shrine was able to

    enact a powerful counter ritual. As long as the shrine has at least a single

    lit candle, the nuribotoke can't get through. A tornado just ripped through

    the area, and the locals are afraid to check on the shrine. What else is

    housed at this shrine that you need?

    What circumstance creates a nuribotoke?

Rank:      Dangerous (2 progress per harm; inflicts  2  harm)

             Ghost of innocent murdered

Features:    Wailing of lack of guilt

             Uncontrollable sobbing

             Drive their killer mad

Drives:      Convince others of their innocence

             Torment other tormentors

             Induce madness

Tactics:     Phase through objects

             Ear-piercing blasts of sound

When an innocent person is tormented and then killed, there is a chance

that their spirit returns to the Firelands as a horror. The okiku horrors

would be sympathetic for this reason except for their penchant for visiting

torment on others. Usually an okiku will hunt down their own killer and

visit madness upon them rather than kill them, but if the okiku thinks that

anyone else they cross paths with is in any way guilty of causing pain, they

are happy to visit torment upon them as well.

In addition to the madness they can induce in others, they also can emit ear-

shattering wails of their own grief. Often these cries are the first indication

that an okiku is nearby.

The ethereal form of an okiku cannot be touched with normal physical

objects. They can phase through sword attacks as easily as they phase

through walls. However, some of our mystics have found particular

blessings that they can bestow upon weapons that for a time will allow a

warrior to drive off okiku. Yes, drive off, for they cannot be killed. Only

when they finish tormenting their own killer will the okiku fade from this

world and finally find rest in the next.

Quest: A particularly ruthless ronin has created a number of okiku

throughout the years and always managed to stay a step ahead of them by

roaming the Firelands far and wide. Unfortunately, the ronin was killed in

a simple climbing accident, and now the okiku are furious that they have

lost the object of their torment. Who do you know that may have a way to

stop these okiku and put them to rest?

YOUR TRUTH

Is it true that the okiku tell their victims they will finish

tormenting them after they count to ten? If so, why?

                 Spread suffering

    Drives:      Harass the living

                 Cause disease with touch

    Tactics:     Disappear and reappear

                 Frighten by looks alone

    The onryo are very similar to the okiku in that they are both vengeful spirits

    that spend their time harassing the living. However, the onryo are known

    to spread disease rather than madness. Those inflicted by the onryo's touch

    have little chance to live, and if they do survive, it will only be after many

    nights of feverish nightmares.

    Additionally, where the okiku silently glide, the onryo simply appear from

    one place to the next. We don't know exactly how far an onryo can use this

    teleportation ability, but it is not as far as one can see. Despite this

    limitation, the fact that they can pop into existence directly behind

    someone and touch them with the curse of disease make them nearly

    impossible for a lone warrior to drive off.

    Quest: A rare herb known as ryu ketsueki, dragon's blood, is thought to be

    able to cure the onryo disease. However, this rare flower only blooms in

    the discarded egg shells of azure dragons. Who do you know that is

    suffering from the onryo sickness so that you are willing to undertake the

    quest to find the dragon's blood flower?

    The onryo are known to be able to frighten with their horrific

    visage. Is this a function of their grotesque nature, or does

    their face morph and change to prey upon individual fears?

Also known the smith's bane, tsukumogami are any item that was treated

with constant abuse and disrespect that then returns 100 years later to seek

revenge on the descendants of its previous master. Whether or not these

bloodthirsty items actually exist or not is a matter of debate, but no one can

deny the peculiar circumstances of some deaths: a person who died falling

on a hammer, one who died with a pair of rusted tongs in the eye, or

another found with a horseshoe wrapped around their neck. Were these

items come to life? Doubtful, but some still believe the stories.

Quest: A fourth generation blacksmith is renowned for the quality of

katana they make, but recently their blades have been snapping

prematurely or detaching the tang from the handle. The smith claims that

he is still using his great-grandmother's tools and that they are turning into

    The very first kuchisake was a deranged serial killer, but she started a fad.

    Some female assassins now follow in her footsteps by slitting their own

    mouths out into wide and gruesome smiles and fanatically spouting the

    hate of vanity and beauty that the original did.

    While many viewed this as a psychological trauma that needed addressed,

    some enterprising daimyo saw this as an opportunity. The daimyo took in

    these fledgling copycats and trained them to be killing machines that they

    could point in any direction they saw fit.

    If a woman with a fan covering her jaw asks you, "Am I beautiful?", you

    should run away. It is likely a kuchisake assassin on the way to a kill who

    wants to use you as the warm-up act.

    Quest: A kuchisake has been killing frequently in one of the largest

Ninja are equally derided and lauded depending on who you speak with.

Most samurai consider them to be without honor due to their willingness

to deceive and work in the shadows, but the common people view them as

folk heroes fighting against oppressive shogun in the only way they can.

Whatever your view of the ninja, it is hard to dispute their effectiveness. A

sole ninja can wage irregular warfare against a squad of samurai in such a

way as to be a significant threat. They are masters at finding out valuable

information and then using that information to their best advantage.

Some claim that secretive schools of ninja exist where they learn varied

skills based on their clan such as turning invisible, walking on water, or

even bending the elements. However, no such school has ever been found.

This much is true: if you are confronted by a ninja, you are already deep

into intrigue whether you mean to be or not. Moreover, you're in grave

danger because if the ninja is allowing you to see them, they are either

desperate or the stakes are higher than you can imagine.

    The samurai are held in the highest respect in the Firelands. Unfortunately,

    they are not always viewed positively as their code forces them to

    obedience to their lord over their own judgments of right or wrong. At

    times they are saviors, and at times they are executioners. While there are

    some corrupt samurai, most are honorable but find that honor at times binds

    too tightly, forcing their hand.

    To become a samurai, one must train for years with a lord as their sponsor.

    At the end of their training, they reaffirm their fealty and are gifted with a

    suit of armor in the daimyo's motif. At that point, their word is nearly

    equivalent to law in the daimyo's domain.

The shiki adepts are a strange group of mystics who hold power over

mindless spirits that manifest themselves as constructs of a paper,

parchment, or vellum-like material. They can direct these spirits at their

whim to use as weapons or as spies.

While the shiki adepts zealously guard the secrets of their magic, it is

assumed that these spirits have some form of intelligence and

communication ability since they can use them as spies. This has led to the

practice of daimyos having no paper in their council rooms so that nothing

can be gleaned by a shiki adept.

No one knows the nature of the shiki spirits. Are they related to ancestral

spirits? Are they primordial in nature? We do not know, but what we do

know is that a shiki adept can be dangerous and is rarely guided by a code

    For example, if you roll and get 18 and 52 to get Washiasase or Eagle's

    Ford, you might decide to name the settlement Ford of the Walking Eagle.

    I thought of adding "walking" because why would an eagle need to ford a

    river? Next I start developing a Firelander myth of a great eagle yokai that

    wanted to learn what it meant to be human and so gave up their wings for

    a year and a day. On the day that the eagle was to get back its wings, the

    river flooded and the eagle jumped in to save the person it had fallen in love

    with during the last year. The person survived, but the eagle yokai did not.

    Now the people living in the Ford of the Walking Eagle honor its sacrifice

    each year in the spring.

55                     THE FIRELANDS |     BASED  ON JAPANESE MYTHOLOGY
PRONUNCIATION

I actually took Japanese in high school, so I have the tiniest bit of

knowledge that I can share to help you get more immersion in your games.

Japan uses three alphabets: hiragana, katakana, and kanji. Hiragana are the

base "letters" of the Japanese language that are actually full sounds instead

of letters as we think of them in English. There are a limited number of

basic sounds that every Japanese word is made with just like there are only

26 letters in the English alphabet.

Katakana are the same sounds, but with different symbols meant to show

that the words have a foreign origin (at least that's how it was explained to

me in the courses I took).

Kanji are symbols that represent full words, and as such, there are tons of

different kanji that can be used.

In this supplement, I used a mixture of hiragana and kanji for the symbols

of the regions, but all the Japanese words written in English use the basic

pronunciation of hiragana.

The Japanese hiragana start with five basic vowel sounds:

Hiragana                                                         

In English  a                      i          u            e     o

Sound       Short a;        Long e;     /u:/ or oo;  Long a;     Long o;

            as in water     as in reed  as in igloo  as in day   as in wrote

There are then 40 distinct consonant-vowel unions that are the same sounds

as above but with a consonant sound in front such as these five with "k":

Hiragana                                                         

In English  ka                     ki         ku     ke          ko

Sound       kah;            key;        koo; as in   kay;        ko;

            as in cop       as in key      cuckoo    as in okay  as in coke

Finally, there is the lone "n" sound () that can be put at the end of any of

the other sounds like "kan" or "kin".

Therefore, when you pronounce one of these words, it should go syllable

by syllable. For example, consider these:

      Kagekatsu is pronounced "Kah-gay-kah-tsu" with the "ts" running

       together like a "T" in front of "Sue"

      Kawabune is pronounced "Kah-wah-boo-nay"

      Modoromi Oka is pronounced "Mah-doe-roe-mee Oh-kah"
