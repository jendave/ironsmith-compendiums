THE GRASSLANDS

Inspired by Mythologies across Africa
   THE GRASSLANDS

   Each Flavor Pack for the Ironsworn RPG is inspired by some culture's

   mythology. The ideas presented are not exact duplicates of myths,

   cultures, or creatures from those cultures, but rather are general ideas

   meant to evoke a slightly different feeling rather than the viking-like

   setting of the Ironsworn core setting.

   The Grasslands Flavor Pack was inspired by mythologies from across

   Africa but heavily draw from Zulu traditions and culture.

   The Grasslands were supposed to be a continent that allowed a

   new start for our people. It's earthy, muted colors inspired feelings

   of peace and plenty while the plethora of fauna for hunting

   signaled a land healthy and able to provide for the massive

   numbers fleeing the Old World. Unfortunately, we found otherwise.

   For starters, the fauna fought back. Lions prowled the savannahs,

   hippopotamuses and crocodiles lurked in the waters, and

   venomous snakes struck silently from the shadows. Even the

   slightly less dangerous animals such as the water buffalo and

   gazelle still could deal fatal damage to our hunters unless we were

   well prepared. The animals of the Grasslands are made of hearty

   stuff and did not take to our coming well.

   Then we were surprised to find some areas of the Grasslands held

   evidence of occupation by malevolent firstborn. They may have

   been here years ago, but the ruins we have found point to the fact

   that they may still stalk the realms. We dare not venture too far

   from our settlements lest we be met with a swift spear from the

   grasses.

   Even the flora found ways to frustrate us. Plants that should have

   been poisonous were actually vibrant grains while the succulent

   appearing fruit sent many Grasslanders to their grave.

   The environment itself works against us as periods of drought are

   followed by colossal bursts of rain leading to short periods of

   abundance where we must try to store enough to make it through

   to the next rain. Growing crops in such a place is extremely

   difficult, and takes proper irrigation where we risk the wrath of

   crocs and hippos.

   We have spread out in smaller tribes across the realm just trying to

   survive in this harsh new home. Every year we worry that it will

   be our last as we fend off raiders, follow the dwindling herds, and

   pray for rain. Welcome to the Grasslands.

NEW REGIONS

Each region in the Grasslands corresponds to a region on the normal

Ironsworn map. In this way, you can continue to use the same map while

still getting a new flavor for the setting. I have updated the names based

on the most recent Google translate, but I am not a native speaker. Google

gave me different words this time when translating from English to Zulu,

so please take these with a grain of salt.

The original Ironsworn regions change as follows:

1. Barrier Islands  Amagwebu Umlilo (Bubbles of Fire)

2. Ragged Coast  Amafu Ayisicaba (The Flat Clouds)

3. Deep Wilds  Ihlathi Lenkawu (Jungle ofApes)

4. Flooded Lands  Ukuhamba Ixhaphozi (The Walking Swamp)

5. Havens  Utshani Obude (The Tall Grass)

6. Hinterlands  Ihlathi Lemikhonto (Forest of Spears)

7. Tempest Hills  Umbani Ekhaya (Lightning Home)

8. Veiled Mountains  Iminwe Kankulunkulu (Fingers of God)

9. Shattered Wastes  Ukusha Okungapheli (The Forever Burn)

   AMAGWEBU UMLILO                                             BUBBLES OF FIRE

   Replaces: Barrier Islands (Region 1)

   Features:

     Land constantly undulating           Thick barked trees with

      with the waves                        shallow roots

     Slowly expanding beaches of          Islands that move with

      lava rock                             the currents

     Resilient wild life                  Steaming coastlines

   The Amagwebu Umlilo are multiple archipelagos said to be formed from

   lava bubbles of a super volcano at the ocean's floor that cooled as they

   defied the laws of nature and rose to the surface. Somehow, this left islands

   that can freely move with the ocean current. They have a hot rainy season

   with frequent destructive cyclones followed by a relatively cool dry

   season. Possibly due to the rapid changes in water temperatures, the

   islands stay near their point of origin. Some speculate that there are semi-

   cooled lava strands beneath the islands keeping them literally on a chain.

   Spiny forests of baobab trees, whistling thorns, and wooden versions of

   cacti hug the coasts of each island. Poisonous spiders with chitinous

   tortoise shells patrol the islands and fuel nightmarish stories told to wary

   travelers.

   The Grasslanders who make their homes here use elaborate means of

   gathering rain simply to have enough fresh water to drink, let alone grow

   the few edible plants capable of surviving in such a harsh environment.

   Quest: Sometimes the cooling lava floating up to the surface forms into a

   perfect sphere known as lava globes. Mystics have found these natural

   phenomenon to be excellent foci for the mystic arts, particularly for

   producing light. One such mystic is asking for a lava globe of unusual size

   and is obsessive about finding one. What purpose will the globe serve for

   them, and why are willing to risk the pirates to find one?

AMAFU AYISICABA                                        THE FLAT CLOUDS

Replaces: Ragged Coast (Region 2)

Features:

 Waves crashing against                  Drums sounding as

sheer rock cliffs                        pirates near

 Endless stair steps of rice             Fieldhands armed with spears

 Roaming herds atop mesas                Deep brown plateaus

TheAmafuAyisicaba are large plateaus whose edges jut out over the ocean

on the western coast of the Grasslands. Legend says that once the ocean

breaks down the last of the plateau underrock, the plateaus will float up into

the heavens rather than fall into the sea. Hence, the name: Flat Clouds.

Small valleys exist between the plateaus on the coast which flood with sea

water during high tide. The Grasslanders who live here subsist on a rare

species of saltwater rice which they grow in tiered patties filled by the

tides. Living in huts on the flat plateau tops above their patties gives them

a position that is easily defended from foes but unfortunately exposed to

the elements. They are always looking for stout building materials that can

withstand the coastal winds and storms.

Some tribes of Grasslanders have semi-domesticated a species of water

buffalo to live on the rocky plateau tops. This demands long and arduous

trips further inland to bring soil to the tops so that grass can grow for the

livestock to feed on, and the trips can be dangerous if they enter regions

controlled by firstborn.

Quest: There is one plateau with a huge spire of rock thrusting towards the

sky in the center that has thus far been inaccessible to the Grasslanders.

The spire is large enough to be seen from afar and has inspired many

expeditions to see what it is, but all have failed. What do you think the

spire represents, and why is it important to you?

IRONSMITH: FLAVOR PACKS                                                         5
   IHLATHI LENKAWU                              JUNGLE OF THE APES

   Replaces: Deep Wilds (Region 3)

   Features:

    Great silver-backed apes assert   Towering trees of

   their dominance                    exceptional girth

    Thick, hanging vines              Steamy humidity

    Constant hoots and howls          Ever-present patter of rain

   The Ihlathi Lenkawu is a massive rain forest filled with a cacophony of

   sound, mysterious creatures, and prowling firstborn. Huge beasts and

   over-sized animals are clearly the masters of this domain. Sightings of an

   ape that towers over the tallest trees are commonly claimed but never

   confirmed as the jungle does not give up its secrets easily.

   Upon first discovering this place, we eagerly attempted to explore it

   thinking that it could provide fruit, medicinal plants, and even building

   material, but we were quickly defeated simply by the forces of nature. It is

   whispered around campfires that the jungle itself is sentient and harbors ill

   will toward the Grasslanders who don't belong to this realm. Those who

   have sought to explore the interior of the forest are so often lost that it has

   developed into a colloquialism to refer to doomed projects as "ukwenza

   imephu yehlathi", or "making a jungle map".

   Quest: One of the largest silver-backs seen yet made its way to the jungles

   edge and appears to be trying to communicate through hand gestures.

   Eventually, it gave up in frustration and began to clearly beckon you into

   the jungle. While you couldn't fully understand the great ape, there was

   one sign it made that you recognize. What is that sign, and why does it

   frighten you?

UKUHAMBA IXHAPHOZI                         THE WALKING SWAMP

Replaces: Flooded Lands (Region 4)

Features:

 Stagnant waters                           Mud-burrowing eels hidden

 Thick, foul-smelling mud                 and ready to strike

 Mangroves with large,                     Tree-dwelling sloths with

smooth roots                               poison-tipped claws

Ukuhamba Ixhaphozi is a region of mangrove swamp lands protected by a

large coral reef off the southeastern coast of the Grasslands. The giant

mangrove trees have huge roots that look like legs sticking out of the

waters and are known to be able to move at a snail's pace to areas richer in

nutrients.

No one sleeps on the ground in this region lest a tree walk over them in the

night and embed its roots into them. Thus, large family hammocks known

as isandos are seen in every village stretched between large wooden posts

driven deep into the ground or even in the branches of mangroves.

Grasslanders often follow a walking tree to collect the insects or worms as

food that are left behind by its passage.

The animals of this region may seem harmless at first but often have strong

natural defenses such as poison, thick skin or shells, or camouflage.

Quest: Several mangroves have been gathering in tightly knit concentric

rings in one area. What do you suspect is at the center, and why is it urgent

to find out?

IRONSMITH: FLAVOR PACKS                                                        7
   UTSHANI OBUDE                                               THE TALL GRASS

   Replaces: Havens (Region 5)

   Features:

     Long stretches of nothing but      Lone trees standing sentry

      grasses rustling in the breeze     Settlements surrounded by

     Streams crisscrossing the land      earthen walls

     Hunter huts sparsely populating    Stampedes running from

      the grasses                         predators

   Utshani Obude are the plains of the Grasslands. While yellowy-green

   grasses dominate the landscape, trees such as the fever trees with

   photosynthesizing bark, leadwood trees as heavy as iron, and the iconic

   dragonblood trees dot the landscape. The trees are considered such a

   critical part of the plains that when Grasslanders swear an iron vow, it is

   considered acceptable for a destitute person to use leadwood as an iron

   substitute.

   Large hunting cats prowl the plains taking down huge game of elephants

   or even rhinos. While there are many streams throughout this region, they

   are small enough that animals still must compete for the precious resource

   of water. As such, predator species have learned to patrol the waterways

   knowing that the prey will eventually come to them.

   While still a harsh environment, we have found that if we respect and live

   in harmony with nature, this region is the most hospitable. Some tribes

   have even learned to tame and ride the rhinos into battle.

   Quest: A particularly large dragonblood tree is known as the Weeping God

   and held sacred by the Tchide settlement folk.              Since before the

   Grasslanders appeared on these soils, the tree has slowly wept thick,

   bloody tears, but it stopped weeping one week ago. The locals say this is

   an omen of ill to come. What tragic event do they say this foretells, and

   what vision did you see when you first gazed upon the Weeping God?

IHLATHI LEMIKHONTO                                       FOREST OF SPEARS

Replaces: Hinterlands (Region 6)

Features:

 Sparse and spindly trees          Game trails clearly worn

 Isolated settlements surrounded   Morning fog and mist

by large cultivated quiver trees    Sparse undergrowth from the

 Regular foraging parties         acidic soil

Ihlathi Lemikhonto is known for its narrow-trunked quiver trees whose

branches resemble long arrows. Grasslanders here have learned to harvest

these branches to use as weighted spears which they hurl with devastating

accuracy.Additionally, if the branches are cut away properly, the tree leaks

a clear, aloe-like sap that can be used in healing poultices. While the area

is known for quiver trees, they do not usually grow in dense clumps but are

spread out through the deciduous forests of the region.

Despite the spareness of the quiver trees, forests of this region can be thick

in places. They are not the jungles of Ihlathi Lenkawu but house equally

large predator beasts who claim the forests as their domain. Prey animals

here will wear down false game trails to intentionally confuse predators as

to where they should hunt.

Quest: A group from the settlement of Goronga was due back from

harvesting the quiver trees days ago, but there is still no sign of them

despite scouts being sent out. Why do you think the group was out to

harvest more than quiver trees, and who is with them that is close to you?

IRONSMITH: FLAVOR PACKS                                                         9
    UMBANI EKHAYA                                                 LIGHTNING HOME

    Replaces: Tempest Hills (Region 7)

    Features:

          Dry and arid scrublands       Large scorpions eager for kills

          Deep sinkholes where water    Hills breaking lines of sight

           once ran                      Persistent smoke and layers of

          Feathers of lightning birds  ash on the ground

           littering the ground

    The Umbani Ekhaya are highlands covered in scraggy shrubs and flexures

    of the planet's crust known as massifs. During the rainy season, lightning

    birds, called impundulu, flock across the region burying themselves in

    holes left behind after lightning strikes. Their spoor and eggshells left after

    mating season help to fuel the growth of thick bushes known as ukuvuleka,

    the openmind, with bright red flowers that release an intoxicating and

    hallucinogenic pollen.

    Grasslanders who live in this area will go on spirit quests towards the

    mountains through dense areas of this red-flowered bush with only a

    rough-hewn iron knife as protection from the animals and beasts that

    abound here.

    Shrubs dot the dry land close enough together that scrub fires are common

    after a lightning storm or when a Grasslander is too careless with their fire

    pit. Smoke often dots the horizon, but we have learned to pass through the

    fires using a stout pair of leather pants soaked in water. If a patch of

    ukuvuleka catches fire, settlements must be careful lest everyone be forced

    into hallucinations leaving the settlement ripe for raiders.

    Quest: A huge burrowing creature is said to have taken up residence at the

    base of a steep hill. A member of a local scouting party out on his first

    patrol fell into the creature's pit, and muffled cries can still be heard from

    beneath the whirlpool of dirt and sand. Can he be reached before it's too

    late?

IMINWE KANKULUNKULU                                       FINGERS OF GOD

Replaces: Veiled Mountains (Region 8)

Features:

 Jagged lightning streaking            Caverns winding ever deeper

across the sky                         below the mountains

 Gale force winds of                   Cracks in the rocks wide

numbing cold                           enough for caravans

The Iminwe Kankulunkulu are sometimes called the Fingers of God

because of the five narrow and most prominent peaks protruding out of the

rocky mountainsides. Few Grasslanders venture this far north, but the

peaks can be seen as far south as the Utshani Obude's northern border

where the inhabitants use them as a compass calling the eastern most peak

Isithupha, the thumb.

Grasslanders have attempted to mine some areas of these mountains, but

many were abandoned shortly after being built. Not only was it difficult to

get the ore back to other regions, but we quickly learned that many

dangerous denizens call the cavernous depths their home.

At times, great streaks of lightning can be seen jumping from peak to peak

even when there are no storms which has led some to speculate that a giant

lightning bird the size of a large dragon makes it home within the peaks.

Others say the lightning is a consequence of the extreme altitude of the

Fingers. Still others say it is part of a natural barrier keeping the denizens

of Ukusha Okungapheli at bay.

Quest: A local shaman claims to have connected with the mother of all

impundulu who granted the shaman power over lightning. Now the

shaman's settlement is being targeted by raiders who want the power for

themselves. Why does the settlement need the shaman's newfound ability?

IRONSMITH: FLAVOR PACKS                                                         11

    Features:

     Unending sea of sand                  Withered plant life attempting

     Bones of those who have              to grow despite conditions

    come before                             Sandstorms coming from

     Haze of unbearable heat              nowhere and lasting too long

    The Ukusha Okungapheli is a vast desert region where few Grasslanders

    have explored. The area is littered with dead animals who attempted to call

    this area home. Scavengers survive by virtue of the short rainy season

    leading to a bloom of life-giving plants that wither in the heat nearly as

    swiftly as they grow.

    Sandstorms constantly skirt across this region with odd jerks and starts.

    They will pop-up with no warning and move seemingly at random.

    Sometimes they will even stay in one spot as if to torture a particular area.

    It is said that this region is ruled by a powerful witch doctor who

    continually grinds bones to make more sand for the endless dunes out of

    the animals and people who dare enter the region. Legend says that if you

    could travel far enough north, you would find a great rondavel made

    entirely of sand where the death-focused witch doctor performs his grisly

    rituals.

    Quest: A mystic is asking for an unground bone from Ukusha Okungapheli

    claiming it will have properties of resistance making it a powerful artifact.

    Why does this level of protection peak your interest?

12               THE GRASSLANDS | BASED ON AFRICAN MYTHOLOGY
NEW ASSETS

Just as the terrain and regions are different in the Grasslands, so too are the

people and their skills. Here are some assets unique to the Grasslands.

COMBAT TALENTS

Having skills with a weapon is a critical survival skill in the Grasslands not

only for protection from raiders but also for hunting. Most Grasslanders

learn to use several different types of weapons and use them each

depending on which type of animal they are hunting.

Because of this dependence on weaponry, there are competitions held

every summer for the youth of each settlement. The young person who

wins the tournament is granted the status of adulthood despite their not

coming of age yet.

You may also consider renaming the Skirmisher combat talent as Assegai.

While the assegai was a throwing spear (also known as isula as presented

in this Flavor Pack), you could say that in the Grasslands the assegai

became a normal spear where the isula was specifically the throwing

spear.

IRONSMITH: FLAVOR PACKS                                                          13
    IKLWA

    The iklwa spear was designed

    for close-quarters combat. The

    spear is less than an arms-length

    with the upper third being a

    wide-bladed tip. It was named

    for the sound it makes when

    being pulled out from an

    opponent's body.

    Whereas Grasslanders may take

    many throwing spears into battle

    to use like javelin, each warrior

    only carries one iklwa due to the

    amount of iron used to make

    them. Many overseers do not

    allow their warriors back into

    the settlement after a battle

    unless they can show that they

    still retain their iklwa.

    Design Notes: Traditionally the

    iklwa became well known for

    being plunged into the backs of enemies. The first ability represents this or

    other situations where the foe is clearly at your mercy such as having their

    shield busted or exposing their flank without armor or other protection.

    The second ability represents the change in battle habits that Shaka Zulu

    inspired with his use of the iklwa. Since the spear was not designed for

    throwing (and in fact was forbidden to be thrown), the warriors became

    much more aggressive at getting into melee range. With these spears being

    shorter in length (around two feet or a little more than half a meter),

    warriors had to get within their opponent's reach to be most effective.

    The third ability leans into the traditional aggressive use of the weapon as

ISIHLANGU

Isihlangu are shields made of

layers of hardened cowhide.

Despite the fact that they are

almost as tall as the average

Grasslander, they are balanced

so well that they can be wielded

easily with one hand.

While these shields don't have

the durability of a wooden or

metal shield, the Grasslanders

have become experts at using the

isihlangu for deflecting attacks.

Incoming spears can be shunted

away from the defender with

little more than a small tear in

the shield if it twisted at just

right angle at just the right

moment in the spear's flight. It

is also useful for redirecting

momentum in melee combat and

helping one get into a better

position on the battlefield.

Design Notes: The first ability gives you the option to shield bash in such

a way as to gain a better vantage point to Strike with the next blow. Yes,

you give up a little damage, but you are better positioned as you take the

initiative.

The second ability is similar to the normal Ironsworn asset of Shield-

Bearer, but this is a bit weaker since the cowhide is not as sturdy.

The third ability is another way to set-up a solid Strike by first using Secure

an Advantage to gain the add +1 that will lend to your Strike. Using your

shield makes the Secure an Advantage more likely with an add +1 to that

roll in the first place. You could also use the advantage you gain for other

purposes such as running away while your opponent is down or asking

your foe to surrender via the End the Fight move.

Quest:Agroup of renowned leather workers believe they have found a way

to cut away usable patches of chipekwe hide, some of the toughest skin

known in the Grasslands. Having a shield made of such skin would surely

give any warrior an enviable advantage in combat. Where have you heard

of a larger than normal chipekwe, and why have so many hunting parties

failed to bring it down?

IRONSMITH: FLAVOR PACKS                                                          15
    ISIJULA

    The isula spear was designed

    for ranged combat. Much like a

    javelin, warriors tend to bring

    several of these to a battle and

    collect the unbroken ones after

    the battle is over.

    Some of the best isula are made

    from the quiver tree and may

    have only a sharpened tip rather

    than an iron tip. Sometimes, an

    isula is made of leadwood, but

    these are rare because of the

    amount of work needed to carve

    them into the right form. More

    often than not, an isula is made

    from a lightweight, flexible

    wood with a small iron or stone

    blade embedded in the end.

    A  common            strategy  when

    wielding isula is to throw one

    high so that it is coming down on an enemy and quickly follow it with a

    fast, level thrown isula straight at the same enemy. In this way, the foe

    must decide how to use their shield as they can't block both weapons at the

    same time.

    Design Notes: The first ability is a first strike method much like with a

    sling. By throwing multiple spears during the opening volley, you have a

    greater chance of dealing damage.

    The second ability is a bonus you get every time you use the weapon. At

    first glance, that may seem overpowered, but remember that you then lose

    the weapon. While it's true that you may have 5-7 isula in a quiver, there

    is a limit. Additionally, it's hard to keep yourself in a ranged attack

    position for very long, and isula are ineffective in melee.

    Hence, the third ability: Face Danger to get into a better position.

    Narratively speaking, after the first throw, the foe is likely to try to close

    distance with you. This gives you a way stay at a distance to keep using

    your ranged weapons or recover thrown weapons when you run out.

    Quest: The settlement of Tukawe holds an annual tournament where the

    competitors show off their skills with the isula on an obstacle course set

    with many targets. The prize for this year's competition is highly unusual.

    What is it, and why does it bode ill?

16                       THE GRASSLANDS | BASED ON AFRICAN MYTHOLOGY
IWISA

The iwisa is a largely ceremonial

weapon and rarely used in actual

combat as more formidable

weapons are not hard to come

by.    However, some warriors

will take the time to create an

iwisa out of the dense leadwood

trees making it on par with

normal weapons.

There are two main offensive

uses of the iwisa: throwing and

stunning. While it may sound

laughable to throw an iwisa, the

round weighted end can deliver

quite a blow from a distance.

The spherical end is also good

for knocking a foe senseless for

a time if you can land a solid

blow to the head.

Defensively, a stout iwisa can be

used to block incoming attacks.

Design Notes: The first ability makes the club a deadly weapon (dealing 2

harm instead of 1), but also gives the additional boost for when you throw

it at a foe. However, unlike isula, warriors don't usually carry multiple

iwisa, so after the club is thrown, it will need to be recovered.

The second ability is your standard bell-ringer which gives you a way to

keep the initiative on a weak hit with a Strike.

The third ability represents relying on the sturdy nature of leadwood to not

only protect you but also jar your foe enough to give you some momentum

in the battle.

Quest: The Baton of Botswu is the ceremonially weapon of the leader of

several loosely aligned settlements. Whoever holds the weapon is declared

the leader and keeps that leadership by their ability to keep the weapon in

their possession. The Baton has gone and the region is dissolving into

chaos. What impact will this have on the area, and who do you know that

stands to benefit from this destabilization?

    COMPANIONS

    To better fit the Grasslands setting, you may consider changing the Cave

    Lion companion asset to a regular lion or leopard and changing the

    Mammoth asset to an elephant. Here are three additional companions

    commonly found in the Grasslands.

    IMPISI

    The impisi are one of the most

    common predators across the

    Grasslands and come in three

    varieties: striped, spotted, and

    brown. They stalk the plains not

    only as scavengers but also

    intelligent pack hunters.

    The impisi may also be called

    "bone crushers" because of their

    preference for bone marrow and

    their ability to crack even the

    thick leg bones of elephants to

    get at the marrow.

    Design Notes: The first ability

    may seem odd because you are

    taking a -1 to supply while

    resupplying, but remember that

    you get +2 supply on the

    Resupply move. This represents

    the fact that hyenas are great

    hunters, but they're going to take  their  cut  of  the  kill  first.

    The second ability represents the pack-hunting ability of hyenas, but it is

    still dependent on wits.

    The third brings in the trope of laughing hyenas. While you get to add +1

    every time you Secure an Advantage or Strike with the hyena laughter,

    remember that this also exposes your companion to harm.

    Quest: The local blacksmith for the village of Nobawayo has been

    implicated in the death of a child and accused of being a bouda, one who

    can transform into a hyena with the help of a magic stick. Now the

    blacksmith is on the run. Something about this scenario reminds you of a

    curse in a fable you heard from a griot, a historian and storyteller. What

    is the story, and what role did the magic stick play in the curse?

18                      THE GRASSLANDS | BASED ON AFRICAN MYTHOLOGY
INGULULE

Perhaps the swiftest creature in

the Grasslands, the ingulule can

reach incredible speeds in short

sprints. The only way to be safe

from these hunters is to never be

within their sprinting distance.

Ingulule, also called cheetahs,

are known for their keen eye

sight. The distinctive black tear

marks on their faces help to

deflect the sun giving them

better vision during day hunts

and also act as part of their

overall camouflage blending in

with the grass and shadows.

Grasslanders have great respect

for the cheetahs and their ability

to hunt small game. Often, a

small contingent of hunters will

take up position opposite a

group of cheetahs with a herd of gazelles between them. When the

cheetahs strike, the gazelles run straight to the waiting Grasslanders. The

cheetahs allow this because they get their meal first, and the Grasslanders

enjoy having satiated rather than hungry cheetahs nearby.

Design Notes: The first ability is similar to the Cave Lion asset, but with

small game instead of large game.

The second ability is similar to the Hound asset, but you are dependent on

the stealth of your cheetah, hence, the change from +wits to +shadow.

The third ability is an adaptation of the cheetah becoming a companion.

They know that if they can immobilize the prey, their human compatriot

may be able to get them a meal that much faster.

Quest: A rare female king cheetah, one with larger blotches instead of

spots, has been sighted near the village of Kuletau. The local shaman says

this is a sign of divine favor, but a local hunter dishonored the king cheetah

by taking away her three cubs. Since then, a curse has befallen the village,

and the hunter has fled with the cubs. What is the nature of this curse, and

why is the hunter resolute in not giving the cubs back to the mother?

    OBHEJANE

    To form a bond with an obhejane

    is a rare feat in the Grasslands.

    Their thick hide, powerful build,

    and sharp horn make them one

    of the animals at the top of the

    food chain, and they know it.

    They generally solve all their

    problems  by  charging  and

    goring whatever is in front of

    them.

    However, there are rumors that a

    whole village has trained a

    group of rhinos as mounts. They

    charge into battle atop the

    muscular creatures and bowl

    over their enemies as if they

    were dry twigs in a violent wind

    storm.

    Design Notes: Note that the first

    ability can only be used against

    multiple foes. It's supposed to represent the rhino trampling all in their

    path and dealing damage indiscriminately and maybe even accidentally.

    The second ability is similar, but for when you Enter the Fray with a bold

    warrior's shout something like, "Waganda for eternity!" This can also be

    used to Secure an Advantage by getting you quickly into position, flanking

    a foe, cutting a foe off from their compatriots, etc.

    The third ability represents the thick skin of the rhino. They are just so

    much harder to hurt because of their hide.

    Quest: Legends tell of a group of extremely large obhejane who stomp out

    fires with their great feet. An obsessed mystic seeking out the fire-stompers

    has been setting villages on fire near areas where large obhejane have been

    sighted in hopes of drawing out the creatures. The mystic either doesn't

    care about or is oblivious to the loss of Grasslander lives in the fires and

    has yet to be stopped in their mad quest. What does the mystic hope to

    gain, and why are they cavalier with taking human lives? Who do you

    know that was affected by the last village fire?

PATHS

Path assets in the Grasslands often are associated with a specific animal

who has made an impact on the lifestyle of the Grasslanders.

INDLELA YE INKENTSHANE

The wild dogs of the Grasslands

are hunters of great endurance.

Their  preferred    method          of

hunting is to chase a medium- to

large-sized   prey      for  great

distances until the prey is finally

exhausted and can run no more.

The dogs take turns rushing in to

nip at the preys legs and rump to

keep it running until it gives up.

Followers of the Indlela Ye

Inkentshane echo that endurance

in their travels and movements.

They train and push their bodies

to the limits of human endurance

with   the    philosophy     that

persistence is the key to success.

Design Notes:The first ability is

similar to Wildblood but has a

slightly narrower scope thereby

allowing the +1 momentum as

well as the add. This represents the wild dog's hunting skill.

The second ability represents the wild dog's methodology of hunting.

They move carefully to find their prey, then persevere on the long and

exhausting chase, and finally move in for the kill with a fresh jolt of

adrenaline.

The third ability represents the wild dog ability to rest after such exertion.

They know the value of proper recovery before the next hunt and how to

recover even during the lean times.

Quest: The settlement of Okashatjo is known for their runners who deliver

vital messages throughout the region. They don't stop, day or night, until

they have reached their destination. However, there is one place the

runners won't go, and the overseer needs a message delivered there. What

is it that the runners fear, and why would the overseer be interacting with

that region?

    INDLELA YE INYATHI

    The buffalo of the Grasslands

    are famous for their fury and

    how they wield their horns with

    deadly     accuracy.          Despite

    generations of trying, these

    creatures     have     never  been

    domesticated or tamed. They

    are simply too wild, too strong,

    and too wise to trust humans.

    Those who follow the Indlela Ye

    Inyathi emulate the qualities of

    the buffalo.   They know the

    value of a multi-pronged attack

    and use their brutal ferocity to

    set the tone of any battle. The

    Grasslanders have a saying:

    "Never charge a bull," and the

    way of the buffalo produces

    many bulls.

    Design Notes: The first ability

    comes from the Zulu's attack pattern popularized by King Shaka. Notice

    that the ability can only be used to Battle and that you must be leading and

    directing the troops.

    The second and third abilities brings out the fury of the buffalo. The

    second represents the defensive reaction of attacking with a violent charge.

    A buffalo doesn't fret or worry about strategy when reacting to a threat.

    They charge, gore, and stomp their opponent.

    The third allows your character to Draw the Circle with the brashness of

    boldness of power rather than courage as well as giving a bonus to Compel

    when used in the same manner. Youseektoleadbytheoldadageof"might

    makes right."

    Quest: A group of raiders have been unstoppable because they deploy both

    sound tactics and ruthless ferocity in battle. It is said that their leader once

    routed a force five times the size of their own without the loss of a single

    raider. Who is the leader of the raiders, and how did you cross paths with

    this person previously?

22                      THE GRASSLANDS | BASED ON AFRICAN MYTHOLOGY
RITUALS

Ritual magic and mysticism in the Grasslands is generally is held in high

regard. Shaman and other practitioners are seen as the only people capable

of holding back spirits and other horrors. They are sought out for both

healing and protection.

SANGOMA

Sometimes referred to as witch

doctors or shaman, the sangoma

are the traditional healers of the

Grasslands. They rely on a deep

connection with the spiritual

realm facilitated by ancestral

spirits. By allowing ancestors to

speak through them or imploring

the spirits of animals, a sangoma

can perform astonishing feats of

healing.

Design Notes: In traditional

Zulu culture, there are two types

of  traditional  healers:        the

sangoma   who    focuses         on

divination for healing and the

inyanga   who    focuses         on

medicines and decoctions made

from animals or plants.          I've

combined both approaches in

this Grasslands interpretation.

The first ability is more versatile and less potent than the standard Heal

move. With the add +1, you also have a higher chance of success. In

traditional sangoma practice, this would be performed in a sacred healing

hut called an indumba or a makeshift one called an imsamo.

The second ability focuses on the divination part to avoid future calamity

allowing you to changed any single missed roll into a hit.

The third ability is a more powerful healing because it helps to cleanse a

person from a bane or burden which is normally permanent. You get an

idea for a fetch quest of ingredients to put together a healing poultice called

a muti that may be powerful enough to cleanse the patient (depending on

how you Fulfill Your Vow). Astrong hit makes the vow easier.

Note that all these moves are performed on a patient, not on yourself.

Quest: A sangoma seeks help holding demon spirits at bay. What angered

the spirits, and how is their wrath manifesting?

IRONSMITH: FLAVOR PACKS                                                          23
    UKUHLANZWA EMPINI

    The Grasslander warriors have

    strong traditions surrounding

    their battles.  They generally

    believe that the spirits guide the

    outcomes of battle in accordance

    with what is deemed as right and

    just. However, they also know

    that having purity of heart and

    performing certain rituals can

    appease the spirits before a

    battle thereby granting the

    warrior a higher chance of

    success.

    While ritualistic in nature, these

    actions are not seen as magic per

    se but only as part of the

    mystical nature that goes along

    with all of life. Warriors using

    these methods are not viewed as

    mystics, just smart because they

    prepare adequately for battle.

    Design Notes:The first two abilities give you a boost to starting a fight and

    absorbing the first hit in a fight. The warrior who undergoes these rituals

    is better prepared mechanically as well as narratively.

    The third ability is a show of respect between warriors. They may be

    opponents on the battlefield, but in the realm of the spirits, they are equal

    and family. Respect can still be shown despite one side losing.

    Quest: The leader of a band of raiders has denied the rite of qaqa to any

    who fall in battle during their raids. The leader says both the raiders and

    the raided are unworthy if they are defeated. Now, some of the raiders are

    defecting because of this unnatural practice. What secret information does

    one such defector bring to you, and why does it move you to swift action?

NEW FOES

The foes of the Grasslands tend toward animal hybrids more than the

standard fantasy creatures. They are almost more extraordinary than your

typical dragon or phoenix because of their hodgepodge of ordinary

attributes mixed together.

As always, these foes are not the exact same as their namesakes, but that

was the starting place for creating a foe that fit the Ironsworn system and

Grasslands setting. Additionally, where the majority of the assets take their

cues from Zulu culture, the foes presented here are from across Africa.

While my preference would have been to pull monsters from only Zulu

legends, I was unable to find enough in my surface-level research to give

the 20+ foes presented here. If you know of any more specific legends from

Zulu mythology that could be converted to foes, please let me know!

                 Charge and gore

    Tactics:     Tear out throats

                 Stomp and crush

    The hippopotamus is a dangerous creature that we must be cautious of

    every time we approach water. Imagine our surprise when we found there

    was a creature that even the hippos feared. The chipekwe seems to be a

    cross between an elephant and a rhinoceros. It has the same thick, gray

    skin, a single horn on its stubby snout, and ears smaller and more rigid than

    an elephant that act as protection for the chipekwe's head.

    The chipekwe are apex hunters in the Grasslands. While lions or hyenas

    will occasionally try to take one down, they rarely succeed, and if they do,

    it is usually at the cost of several of their pack mates'lives. The chipekwe

    views lions or hyenas as simply a nuisance not worthy of being hunted.

    The main prey of chipekwe are elephants or hippos which they take down

    with a single charge and strong upward thrust of their horn. Once they

    mortally wound their prey in this fashion, they then use the claws at the

    edges of their elephant-like feet to rend great strips of flesh and muscle to

    feast on.

    We have found no reliable way to protect ourselves form these brutes.

    Quest:Arogue chipekwe has developed a taste for human flesh rather than

    pachyderms. It now seeks out villages to use as its food source. Who did

    it maim that you hold dear?

The gbahali resemble an evolved form of crocodile with elongated jaws

full of deadly teeth. However, their back legs are much stronger and longer

enabling them to walk using only their hind legs. Their front legs are also

longer than a normal crocs and end with a single thick claw. The gbahali

can go down on all fours and use a loping stride to achieve great speeds for

short distances.

Unfortunately, they are also good swimmers. Their ridged backs and thick

tail allow them to knife through the water much as a regular crocodile as

long as they keep their legs tucked tightly to their body. They typically

only hunt within a few hours walking distance of water sources because

they also enjoy sunbathing on the rocks beside water.

Quest: Gbahali eggs are a prized delicacy served only to those of the

highest social status. Warriors sent to obtain such eggs often return

maimed if they return at all. However, it is a mark of pride to have

provided such a dish to an overseer or shaman. A clutch of eggs has been

discovered downriver, and an egg-gathering group of warriors has been

assembled. The person who is requesting these eggs wronged you in some

way. How? Why would receiving these eggs be an honor that they are

unworthy of?

Are gbahali bodies narrow for better speed when running, or

are they built more like warthogs for toughness and

                Speed strikes with lightning laced beak

    Impundulu, or lightning birds as they are commonly called, are about the

    size of a peacock. The stalks of their feathers are infused with some form

    of ultra-light metal that allows them to act as a Faraday cage for the birds.

    Small jolts of electricity are constantly pulsing over their bodies which we

    believe are used primarily as an energy source for the birds.

    Perhaps due to their gradual consumption of this energy, the birds are

    constantly seeking out storms where they use their ability to attract bolts of

    lightning to themselves in order to replenish their own electricity. Some

    say that the lightning birds can even summon lightning with their wings.

    If you find lightning birds staying away from a nearby storm, be very

    careful. That usually means the birds are in the service of a mystic who can

    wield and harness the power of lightning. Not only will the birds

    themselves be more aggressive, their master is often nearby and usually

    will go to great lengths to not be interrupted in their work.

    Quest: One flock of impundulu have learned to work together to channel

    thick lightning strikes to specific spots on the ground. Using this ability as

    a kind of drill, they have left shallow tunnels pockmarked across the area.

Rank:       Troublesome (3 progress per harm;  inflicts  1  harm)

               Large, carnivorous eel

Features:      Horse-shaped head

               Grow wings to mate

               Annual mating in tornadoes

Drives:        Live in waterfalls

               Savage bites

Tactics:       Swift headbutt

               Constrict victims

At first glance, the inkanyamba appear to a spear-sized eel except for their

horse-like head plated with thick bone. They live in and around waterfalls

where they prey on any fish falling over the falls. They can achieve swift

enough speeds that they can swim up the waterfall itself for short distances.

The unusual aspect of the inkanyamba comes in the summer months when

they begin to grow wings. As they do so, they swim higher and higher

through the waterfalls and burst out the edges into the air free-falling back

down to the pool below until they finally are able to take full flight. At this

point, they congregate near storm systems looking for tornadoes to form

where they perform a dangerous mating ritual as they twirl inside the

funnel clouds.

We have learned to recognize the sound of the inkanyamba head hitting our

canoes in the water. It only takes a few strikes before they are able to crack

our canoes, so once we hear and feel the first impact, there are only seconds

to either make it to the shore or violently dissuade further attack.

Quest: The force of a nearby waterfall has been eating away at the rock

below it for time immemorial, and a reckless youth dared to swim beneath

the falls discovered not only a school of inkanyamba but a narrow opening

that appears to lead to a cave system behind the falls. Why do you think

this cave system was not made naturally, and what do you hope to find

within it?

YOUR TRUTH

What other activity do the inkanyamba participate in each

season while they have their wings?

    Rank:     Dangerous (2 progress per harm; inflicts  2  harm)

    Drives:     Protect the nest

                Flyby attack with beak

    Tactics:    Retreat if necessary

                Claw with back feet

    The kongamato are the great scavengers of the skies but will also hunt

    small game that presents itself such as unprotected fawns or cubs. They

    use their toothy beak to grind up anything from fresh kills to rigid and dried

    husks left from a weeks old kill. They will often fly over battles knowing

    that food will be available shortly.

    While not as aggressive as many species found in the Grasslands, these

    creatures are nonetheless dangerous if provoked or if they find you

    between them and their food. We have found that the best way to defeat

    the kongamato is to tear their leathery wings and force them to the ground

    where they are far less mobile. Melee weapons are usually deflected by

    their bony beaks, so a sling, spear, or bow are far better for protecting

    yourself during an encounter.

    Quest: A group of kongamato attacked a village in a large group and made

    off with an infant that had been set down so the parents could help fight off

    the creatures. This was unusual because kongamato are usually solitary

    creatures, don't often attack humans, and rarely take prey back to their nest

    without killing it first. The infant was taken alive and has only a slim

    chance of being found in time for a rescue. Whose child was taken, and

    what connection do you have to them?

    YOUR TRUTH

    Are kongamato covered in red feathers or is it only their tail

    that is feathered?

    What do the kongamato use their tails for?

The ufiti are apes of near human level intelligence that have a deeply

savage streak. They rarely exhibit fear and never back down from a

challenge, particularly in their own territory.

We are not sure how these apes acquired such a higher level of intelligence

than their gorilla cousins, but they use their smarts to create rudimentary

tools and shelters. Their social hierarchy and communication is also

enhanced by their expanded sense of self-awareness and ability to think in

terms of future outcomes.

Along with their strength and intelligence, the ufiti can also be swift and

stealthy in their natural forest habitats. When we first encountered the ufiti,

several attacked and killed the Grasslanders on the edge of the group

before we could even spot them. From attacks like these, they gained the

nickname of ghost apes.

Quest: A veritable strike force of ufiti have been strategically attacking

settlements seemingly under the direction of one extremely large ape who

presides over the attack from afar. What is the goal of these attacks, and

how can they be stopped?

YOUR TRUTH

Do the ufiti have silver backs or is all their fur silver?

Are ghost apes particularly stealthy ufiti or are they a whole

separate species with their own features and abilities?

    We don't know how many grootslang there are in the Grasslands. There

    could be only one as all the descriptions including scars seem to line up

    between all the sightings. Encounters with grootslang also tend to occur

    near one particularly deep lake known as the Wonder Hole.

    The Wonder Hole is a lake so wide that we attempt traversing it with boats

    rather than take the several days necessary to go around it. Legend says

    that a vessel on one such journey was carrying a load of rare gemstones

    from the north mountains and was hoping to use the lake and its exiting

    river to deliver the goods south when it was attacked by a grootslang. The

    ship is said to be sunk in the direct center of the lake, but we have yet to

    fashion an anchor with a long enough rope to properly gauge the depth of

    the lake. It may be as deep as a mountain is tall.

    With the grootslang nearby, why do we continue to cross theWonder Hole?

    Raiders often attack those who attempt to circumnavigate the great lake,

    and many believe the grootslang can be dissuaded from attacking by

    tossing a diamond overboard as a sacrifice.

    Quest:Agreat warrior claims to have defeated a grootslang in battle using

    an enchanted spear and bears a huge tusk as evidence, but the body of the

    creature cannot be found at the site of the battle. The warrior is seeking a

    group of brave souls to go on an expedition to find the remains of this

    creature knowing that each part of the carcass could be valuable to mystics

    and crafters.

    Exactly how big is a grootslang?

    If there is more than one, where else can they be found?

Akhodumodumo is a frightening, unstoppable force of nature. If you hear

their deep, guttural croaking, run. Run as fast and as far as your legs will

take you if you value your life at all. These huge, armored frogs are coated

with a slimy layer of poisonous mucus and are not to be trifled with.

These creatures are large enough that they can swallow a horse whole and

frequently do. They can lash out with their multiple tongues and pull their

victims into their mouths with little trouble.

Our one advantage against these behemoths is that they are slow and must

stay near a source of water deep enough to submerge into. While they can

jump long distances and crush trees with their bulk, they always take the

easiest available food.

Quest: A khodumodumo has expanded its territory and is now close to the

settlement of Wanru. A group of hunters is setting out to eliminate this new

threat, but they are unaware of an even greater menace. What dangerous

being or event forced the khodumodumo to move its own territory?

    Tactics:      Tail swat

                  Roll over victims

    Usually a gentle giant, the mokele mbembe are a large herbivore reptile

    species that travel in family pods with their young. They spend much of

    their time in the water but traverse the edges of lakes and rivers by day for

    their preferred meal: the white blossomed liana vine with its milky sap and

    small fruit similar to apples.

    While normally not aggressive, these creatures are easily startled and

    dangerous by their sheer size. With underbellies that reach the height of an

    elephant's head, the creatures can capsize small water vessels when they

    submerge suddenly out of fear.

    On land, they are equally dangerous when provoked as they lash out with

    their whip-like tails that produce loud cracks of thunder. If a predator

    moves too close, they have even been known to fall directly on top of their

    attacker and roll their bulk over the predator until they are little more than

    paste on the ground.

    We have learned to respect the territory of the mokele mbembe and not

    make any sudden movements around them. They will generally tolerate us

    when we leave them be.

    Quest: During mating season, the mokele mbembe males will whip their

    tails back and forth producing thunderous cracks trying to impress a

    female. This season, several pods all met in the same spot on the river near

    the settlement of Odanrixis, and the noise of their mating rituals has

    started several stampedes of the few livestock the settlement has. How can

Tactics:     Poisonous bite

The ninki nanka resemble the mokele mbembe in some ways. They are

only slightly smaller in size, and both have long necks. However, the

similarities end there. The ninki nanka have rough and mottled skin rather

than the smooth skin of the mokele mbembe. They are also carnivorous

and have the natural weaponry to be crafty hunters despite their bulk.

Their skin has markings similar to a giraffe that allows them to hide well

among the twisted trees of a swamp. They are known to stay frozen in

place for hours waiting for prey to come close enough for them to attack,

and start most attacks with a poisonous bite followed by a headbutt meant

to stun and trap their prey with their oddly shaped horns.

For some reason unknown to us, the ninki nanka collect the bones of their

kills and will sleep on mounds of them. It may be that the creatures use the

bones simply to create a solid surface to sleep on in the muddy swamps, or

it could be a show of their prowess as a hunter.

Quest: A ninki nanka is thought to be responsible for a group of missing

adolescents who went out foraging. If the youth have any chance, a rescue

mission must be mounted immediately.

                     Rapid multi-attacks with heads

    The nyuvwira are extremely dangerous foes. These eight-headed serpents

    can tunnel underground almost as quickly as they can slither atop it. Each

    head moves perfectly in tandem with the others to scoop out large chunks

    of earth and pull it behind the creature. We believe the the creature is

    seeking out metals and ores as it digs underground, but it took us a while

    to realize this.

    When we first encountered a nyuvwira, we thought the shaky movements

    of warriors' swords and axes were byproducts of facing an unfamiliar

    opponent, but we soon discovered that the beast itself can send out wide

    pulses that draw metals to itself. If you are right next to a nyuvwira when

    it pulses like this, your sword may be temporarily stuck to the creature's

    hide. In the meantime, it's eight heads have all taken a bite out of you. If

    you're lucky enough to survive that onslaught, the toxins from the

    nyuvwira's skin has likely made contact with you and definitely with your

    weapon. You may run away and live for a time, but the poison will get you

    in the end without immediate assistance.

    We don't know why, but the nyuvwira seem to have a particular hatred for

    humans. Either we are too different from what they are used to seeing, or

    we were not the first humans to walk these lands giving the creatures an

At first we thought the bulgu were nothing more than monsters. They

resemble ogres or trolls in stature but are much more grotesque, and we did

not hear them speak for years. They hunted us, so we hunted them.

Once we captured one alive, we heard their speech, a series of clicks,

grunts, guttural noises, and ill-sounding words, and then we knew it must

be sapient. It then called out to its brethren which led to another attack

where it was freed. Many brave Grasslanders were lost that day.

As far as we can tell, the bulgu typically live on or near rivers. Perhaps it's

merely a water source or perhaps they need water in a much more

amphibious way. We just don't know. We've never been able to find a full

settlement of bulgu, but may the ancestors protect us if we do.

Quest: A bulgu has approached the settlement of Nkurenna roughly

speaking the Grasslander language. It seeks an end to the expansion of the

settlement towards the river and threatens reprisal if ignored. This could

be a chance to learn about bulgu culture if a peace could be brokered, but

    as part of their own bodies.

    They also possess strange mystical abilities exemplified by the bell that

    each one carries. Every bell is unique, but they are all made out of an

    unknown type of wood that resonates deeply when struck. Moreover,

    depending on the specific tone they produce with the bell, different effects

    can be observed. The most common effect is that of holding a Grasslander

    enthralled. The eloko use this ability to catch us off guard and steal our

    mates that they then seduce and use for their own vile purposes before

    eating out their insides.

    Eloko are also known to spread disease through their touch. Whether a

    gangrene of the skin or a blight on our crops, they can sicken anything they

    come in contact with.

The popobawa are generally a war-like people who believe that perpetual

expansion is their right by destiny and power. They value a ritualistic

version of hunting and have a strange sense of a warrior's honor that can

tolerate deceit and ill behavior as long as it is not openly seen.

Might makes right in their tribes, and they even war with each other which

has helped us to stay safer when near them. But you are never truly safe

when near the popobawa. They almost always attack at night and will

happily rush in to take prisoners and swiftly retreat night after night to

wear down an enemy force by attrition.

Their skin is usually some shade of red, and their eye is large and bulbous.

These things along with their ability to shapechange and fly have led many

to believe that the popobawa are really a species of demons that decided to

live on the surface of this mortal realm rather than in the bowels and

abandoned portions of the next realm.

Quest: An unexpected nighttime assault by popobawa has led to the

capture of several citizens of the settlement Karikos. They had no idea they

were near popobawa territory and are worried about further attacks if they

provoke the bat people by sending out a rescue party. Can the villagers be

    In the Old World, we had a ritual of placing small quantities of food at

    significant crossroads as a sacrifice to our ancestors. Upon arriving at the

    Grasslands, we continued this tradition but found that the sacrifices were

    taken not by our ancestral spirits but by the umutwa.

    The umutwa are a folk not more than the height of a thumb, but they have

    the courage, bravery, and perhaps bluster, of those many times their size.

    They breed a multitude of large insects to serve them as mounts, beasts of

    burden, and livestock. They are most known for the iridescent green beetle

    that they harvest their poisons from and the bright red fire ants that they

    ride into battle.

    While beings this small may sound like they are not a threat, we have found

    respect and caution the watch words for dealing with the umutwa. If they

    attack with a full force, they are more than a match for a skilled

    Grasslander. There are simply too many of them, and we are quickly

    overwhelmed.

    One further word of caution: never speak of their small stature while in

    their presence. Trust me.

    Quest: A mystic would like a sample of the umutwa's beetle poison, but

    understandably, they are reluctant to share. Why is having a sample so

    important, and in what way do you feel this encounter would also benefit

    the umutwa?

    YOUR TRUTH

    What do the umutwa legends of creation say about the

    formation of the Grasslands?

ADZE                                                           HORROR

Rank:      Troublesome (3 progress per harm; inflicts 1 harm)

             Vampiric firefly

Features:    Can turn ethereal

             Shapeshift to humanoid

             Possess people to turn them into witches

Drives:      Drain a victim's blood

             Create spawn inside a victim's body

             Stay small and bite

Tactics:     Possess a victim

             Pass on diseases

While the adze can present themselves as a humanoid, do not be fooled.

They are demons or evil spirits who know nothing of the mortal existence.

They live only to drain others of life and then procreate.

It is said that the flashing of an adze firefly puts Grasslanders in a dazed

state so that the adze can land and feed more easily. After slaking their

blood thirst, they will then push eggs beneath the surface of their victims

skin which over time swell and burst forth in their hatching. This is not

always fatal to the victim, but leaves them horrifically scarred or maimed.

Another way the adze secure the means to procreate is by enhancing a

victims connection to evil spirits. This connection usually comes with an

irresistible power that warps the mind of the user and turns them into a

witch. Those Grasslanders who have the powers of a witch are often

willing to use those powers to help the adze find more victims in return for

the promise of even more power.

Quest: During the summer months, fireflies flash a bioluminescent green to

the delight of children across the Grasslands. But near the village of

Tsumegwa, red lights have been seen flashing in the forest signaling an

infestation of adze. The last person to leave Tsumegwa said that the

remaining residents were boarding up their huts as airtight as they could

in hopes of keeping the adze at bay, but that can only be a temporary

solution. Who do you know that is trapped in Tsumegwa, and what do you

suspect is behind the adze infestation?

YOUR TRUTH

The sangoma claim a specific sigil will ward off the adze.     What

does this symbol represent, and what are its origins?

    Tactics:          Stab with spear-like walking   stick

                      Bite

    In the Old World, we would sing our children to sleep. Not any more. The

    demonic chemosit is truly horrific because it targets our most vulnerable,

    our children, by singing playful tunes in an attempt to lure children out.

    Many of the first children we lost thought they were going to a dance

    because they heard the happy music and saw the red glow from the

    creature's mouth that they assumed was a fire. The parents who lost their

    children this way still will not attend bonfire festivals as the pain weighs on

    them too heavily.

    Chemosits have a vaguely human face except for their large, triangular

    mouth that resembles a beak. Their torsos are often covered in a dark black

    fur while their very human-like arms are bare.

    We thought that the fact that they have only one bird-like leg would slow

    them down and make them more vulnerable, but alas, it is not so. They

    have the ability to turn into a thick vapor and dissipate to escape attacks.

    While the process is a bit slow and can be interrupted, it is still rare that we

    are able to kill one of these fiends.

    Quest: Three children were found missing this morning and there are

    tracks with a single large bird foot leading out of town. No one knows

    where the chemosit make their home or even if they have one, but time is

    short if the children are to saved. Who do you know that may have the

    means to locate this demon?

    YOUR TRUTH

    How are chemosit created? Is it from the death of a

    particularly corrupt Grasslander? Are they beings from

    another existence? What sort of vulnerability does this

    creation process give the chemosit?

Rank:         Dangerous (2 progress per harm; inflicts 2 harm)

                Giant spectral crab

Features:       Diameter of a human's height

                Hippo-like head on each end

                Eat shadows of people

Drives:         Serve sorcerer or witch

                Follow whistling or high-pitched noises

                Devour shadow

Tactics:        Psychic strikes of fear

                Pincer attacks

Nkala appear to be flat, brown crabs with a hard shell, but they have a head

on either end of their body like the flattened head of a hippopotamus. In

all honesty, we thought they were a laughable creature when we first

encountered them. Little did we know that these are not beasts or animals

but some form of horror empowered by sinister magic. And do not scream

around these creatures, for they are drawn to the sound.

While the crab-like pincers and hippo-like tusks are deadly physical

weapons, the nkala's most dangerous aspects are those connected to their

nature as a horror. Firstly, the nkala have an ability to instill immediate and

powerful fear in a victim. Like a lance through the brain, the fear can

produce physical harm as the heart and blood vessels overload and also

usually cause the victim to freeze in place unable to think clearly enough

to run away.

Secondly, the nkala can eat a person's shadow. This again may not sound

dangerous, but the consequences of not having a shadow are equally

deadly. Over time, a person who has lost their shadow will waste away.

They can see into a realm of death super-imposed onto our world and spend

more and more time there. Without the shadow's ability to cast darkness

out of the body, that darkness builds up and consumes the victim.

Quest: A person has lost their shadow and fears the certain death they

know is coming for them in the weeks ahead. Apowerful mystic claims that

they can create a new shadow for the person, but need a rare artifact.

What does the mystic need? Who is the person that lost their shadow, and

how do you know them?

YOUR TRUTH

Do nkala stay near sources of water, or are they land-dwelling?

    Rank:          Troublesome (3 progress per harm; inflicts  1  harm)

                     Imp-like spirit

    Features:        Summoned by corrupted shaman

                     Covered in hair

                     Avoid holy sites

    Drives:          Serve the shaman

                     Cause mischief

                     Swallow a stone of invisibility

    Tactics:         Bite off toes

                     Present frightening visage

    While some horrors are native to the Grasslands, the tokoloshe are spirits

    of our own making. Corrupted shaman or sangoma summoned these hairy

    spiritual imps as a means of taking revenge which often came in the form

    of killing a person in their sleep. Due to the small stature of the tokoloshe,

    we have found that sleeping raised off the floor of our rondavels is key to

    staying safe.

    The tokoloshe can kill by stealing the breath directly from the lungs of a

    person. After killing a victim, the tokoloshe will desecrate the body by

    eating the toes off the person. If they can't kill someone outright, they are

    content to torment the person with madness-inducing dreams.

    Hunting tokoloshe is difficult because they are small but also because they

    have a supply of magic stones they keep in a bag made of flesh. When they

    swallow one of these stones, they became nearly invisible for a short period

    of time. No one knows what these stones are or where they come from, but

    they frustrate our ability to keep our people safe.

    Quest: An explorer claims to have found a deep cave system where a large

    gathering of tokoloshe harvest their invisibility stones. They are seeking

    someone to help them sneak into the cave and steal some stones for

    themselves. What other deadly being is said to live in this cave system, and

    why would you still be willing to risk joining this task?

    YOUR TRUTH

    Once a tokoloshe is created by a shaman, they continue to exist

    even after released from service. What strange change do the

    tokoloshe undergo once they are released by the shaman that

    makes them even more dangerous?

Drives:      Connect with spiritual realm

             Use voodoo dolls

Tactics:     Dismembering slash

             Transmit psychological afflictions

With great power comes great responsibility, and there are times when our

beloved sangoma, healers, shaman, or mystics go mad with power. They

push their inner powers further than their mind or spirit can fully control.

Once under the delusion of their own grandeur, they seek out ever more

power, but that power always comes at the price of lives.

To fuel their corrupted magics, witch doctors usually hunt those

Grasslanders who happen to have albinism. They grind the bones into a

fine powder that can be used for poultices, potions, or other rituals imbued

with power. Because of this specific need, witch doctors often carry stout

scythes they use to dismember their victims. They may often cut off an arm

or leg and immediately begin the cleaning the grinding process on those

bones while the victim bleeds out from their injuries.

Witch doctors also know the deeper magics involved in the flesh and bone

of humans. Never give a lock of hair, knocked out tooth, or even a clipping

from your nails to anyone. Burn anything that is separated from your body

immediately lest it fall into the hands of a witch doctor who can bind it to

a doll-like effigy giving them power over you.

Quest: A villager lies sick, inflicted with an unknown disease, when the

villager's former lover admits to giving a lock of hair to a witch doctor to

enact vengeance on the person for the perceived romantic slights.

Knowing a witch doctor is responsibility, the overseer believes the disease

can be reversed. What makes you think you know the identity of this witch

doctor? What harm did they previously bring upon you and yours?

YOUR TRUTH

What powers are embedded in the wooden masks of witch

doctors? Is this ability connected to the elves? If so, how?
